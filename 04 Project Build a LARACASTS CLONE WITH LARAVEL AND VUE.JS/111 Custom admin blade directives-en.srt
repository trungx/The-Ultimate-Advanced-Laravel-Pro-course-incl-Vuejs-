1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,120
I'm going to start off by sharing you and every page and I achieved this page by logging out and visiting

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,740
the route to watch a series I'll be receiving this as well because in that while we are trying to get

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,290
the authenticated user.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,110
And he obviously is going to fail because like I told you and locked up.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,940
So this brings us to deciding if we want to permit users to watch series without been authenticated

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,910
or not.

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:30,420
Now if you want to use words to see which with all be authenticated then what are you going to do is

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,790
everywhere for your to and authenticated user you need to wrap this in an IF statement to make sure

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,960
that the user is authenticated before your Trenche you use that feature.

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,820
But if the user is not authenticated then you can skip that feature.

11
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:51,690
OK so what I'm going to do is actually simply take care of this route by securing it with a meter where

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,810
we just off.

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,300
OK.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:00,680
So I'm going to create a mirror work up and put this group with the osme the where.

15
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,060
OK.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,330
And every single water they want to use to be authenticated before assessing.

17
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,880
I'm going to put it in there.

18
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,530
OK.

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,090
So I want to make sure that the result is authenticated before watching a series.

20
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:22,200
So the watch series on the complete lesson would require an authenticated user.

21
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:29,710
So a piece that in so also this where the user can watch a Sui's requires an authenticated user.

22
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,000
So also pasted in and.

23
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,000
I think that's it.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,560
So if you come back and refresh this page we discover that we automatically redirect that to the beach

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,910
where we have to log in.

26
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,260
OK so we haven't customized this view yet but nothing to worry about.

27
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,830
We can take care of that later.

28
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:52,420
So right now we can go ahead and again and everything should return to normal.

29
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:59,710
OK so notice how our status is returned to us when we try to log in use are we using the traditional

30
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,340
method.

31
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:05,490
Because remember we have an AJAX logging functionality in place we don't actually have to tackle this.

32
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,420
And we can use our task to make sure that the user is using a traditional method of authentication is

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,000
actually returned to a view and not a stutterers OK.

34
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,430
OK so now the user is locked in.

35
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:23,830
I just visited the home page and I'll try to visit that route and I can visit the page to watch a series

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,430
again.

37
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,010
OK.

38
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,610
Last thing I want to talk about is this navigation bar.

39
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:35,140
So I want to make sure that the user isn't on the street or before he sees them creates his rounds right

40
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,520
here.

41
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,810
And they also receive out OK.

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:44,050
So we have this is I mean my thought in know I use a class and what we're going to do is head of water

43
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,920
up the bleed Ph be.

44
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,110
And we have these navigation elements right here which we're going to edit.

45
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,540
So why don't we have a costume bleach statement that will help us to check if we use ice at me or not

46
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:07,100
I'll head over to my service provider and we're going to registar the lead if I will call this up me

47
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,260
and plus in this close call and see return off you.

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,070
He's mean because you know I use the last we have these is like I mean my father could help us know

49
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,850
if they use ice on administrators.

50
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,040
So with this key right here we can head about all of that lead.

51
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,190
And when we have this off check we can also have an admin check.

52
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:39,670
So by say I mean house then and I mean OK that looks real convenience then we can take the all serious

53
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,850
route and create Saraswat and paste them right there.

54
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,810
OK.

55
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,390
So let's refresh this page.

56
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:54,550
We see those swabs because issues us on and street all but we're going to go out and then visit our

57
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:01,530
registar page registar our new accounts and click on we just stop and it takes us to the home page.

58
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,890
Now receipts are our home page.

59
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,980
We have just called and then hey the name of the user because this user is not an administrator.

60
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:18,570
He cannot access the creates Sui's page and other pages that are protected for administrators only.

61
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,320
OK.

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:27,010
So remember we have or I mean that we where all the routes that can only be accessed by administrators

63
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,940
are registered.

64
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,200
Therefore even if the user tries to navigate through that speech using the you are out he's not going

65
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,740
to get it.

66
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,440
OK so I think that's a little clean up.

67
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,570
We have a little bit of cleanup patches to do now.

68
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,160
We're going to take care of that before we actually go into the money part of our application.
