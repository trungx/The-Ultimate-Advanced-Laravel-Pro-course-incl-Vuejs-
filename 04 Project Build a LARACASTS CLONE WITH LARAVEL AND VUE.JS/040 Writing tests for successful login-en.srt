1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,480
I mean for writing test for one logging functionality is because we've actually added that the default

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,870
state law will provide for us.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,680
So every single place where we actually admit that something that level provides by default we're going

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,230
to write a little test for that.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,320
For example if we had a waterlogging controller and check out what I think kids at mid-thought we're

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,590
actually doing some things.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,590
So let's go ahead and write a little test to care of this.

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,520
So we're going to see public function test correct response after use our lost in.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:28,890
Right.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,010
So we are making sure that the response that we get is actually what we need right.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,550
So first of all we're just going to use user.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,040
And secondly we're going to make that post request and that is always going to look exactly like the

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,020
one we just wrote.

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,290
Now we want to actually pass in the correct password here.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,780
So we make sure that the user is actually authenticated.

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,860
And then we assert that the status is a 200 meaning successful response.

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,370
We are certain that we have this are we as part of the sun in the response.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,370
So statues.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:58,940
OK.

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,030
So that's the response recently from this.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,840
And the last thing we want to answer utterly absurd is that the session has a particular key.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,000
Now this key is going to be success.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,780
Now we have two options like your of what's test response that ph B which is actually in our level call

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,680
human foundation testing and research for that METAR assert session has just discover that it takes

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,570
in a key and it takes in an optional value so that key is what we just passed in here which is session.

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,270
And then we could actually make sure that the value of that is specified right.

27
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,550
So right here we could say okay we want to make sure that the success message is specifically you are

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,040
successfully lofting just like we having a logging controller or not.

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,200
So in this case I'm just going to help to my logging controller and I'm going to copy the message that

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,120
we have in the session and I'm going to make sure that are logging tests I truly checks for it.

31
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,000
So I think that's going to work perfectly.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,120
Let's go ahead and win a test and see the results that we get.

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,400
So for us to run the specific tests let's just use BHB unit and we're going to filter out to this particular

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,980
test.

35
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,510
OK.

36
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,960
We run it and sure enough we have a successful response.

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,110
So it means our session was set.

38
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,660
Our starters here was you know a decent response and the status of the response was 200.

39
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,680
So we had successfully overturned the defaults for Lavo and our test of told us that everything is OK.
