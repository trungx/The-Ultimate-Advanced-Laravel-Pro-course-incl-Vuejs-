1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,950
That's the Kalf actually quit in our series nursery school.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,350
We need to think about how we want to handle this.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:12,220
So this is us toman thought level of Muscatine Jex and then up the request that contains all the request.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:19,740
So now we have to maybe do things like validation rules like here are actually building the image inside

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,240
here and saving us so the database just inside this method.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,800
So what I actually like to do is create custom requests just for obl. a series or actually creating

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,450
a series.

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,100
So R-La. validation rules are going to be there all our policies are going to be there and maybe some

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,550
of the logic that we have to use to create a series.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,620
So let's go ahead and then read up on his son make request create serious requests so we can go to a

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,010
great series we Quest right now and we're actually going to inject an instance of this class into our

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,830
series controller.

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,930
So rather than these We're going to take hands and level is still going to give us an instance of this

14
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,780
class and simply are quite serious requests extends the formal request by law.

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,400
So we're going to be able to maybe customize some live settings right here but we're still going to

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,640
have access to the underlying requests.

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,300
OK.

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,720
We need to use not so use but cost HGP Quest's and that's to create Sui's request class.

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,550
OK so how do we want this to work.

20
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,340
Let's just discuss the request last.

21
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:26,040
And I'm just going to change this chatroom and this otherwise my thought is actually a method to determine

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,960
if they use less or twice to make these requests.

23
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,280
And this is one of the flexibility that quitting customer request gives us.

24
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,540
So we can actually run a middleware or run a particular check here to see if they use something straight

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,140
off or if he's authorized to create a series.

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,050
And then this is automatically going to protect us rather than having complex statements it will control

27
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,520
us and we can also have our Nation host right here.

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,150
OK.

29
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,310
Now what are we going to do is a lot to follow.

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,990
So we want to upload the file that was sent to us.

31
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,920
The second thing we need to do is create the series.

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,910
And finally we're just going to redirect use up to a page to see our series.

33
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,980
So how are we going to upload the file.

34
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,270
Now our tickets are below that for instance and that is what we get when we are truly on the.

35
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:10,840
And that's.

36
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,570
Eliminate S2P overloaded file and I'm going to walk it through some thoughts that we have.

37
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,740
So now provide us with this fake which is for testing and we're going to see that the.

38
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:26,350
Now we have this for that saw the overloaded fire on a farm system disk right then.

39
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,720
This caused us tossed meth off behind the scenes and looks like this store is simply a wrapper under

40
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,400
our eyes.

41
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:38,450
And he provided a hashed name for our fire buddy who called us toss method directly.

42
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,500
We can actually pass in a custom name then.

43
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,250
Looks like we also have some publicly file so sort of blow the file on a farm system just with public

44
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,270
visibility.

45
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,880
So maybe if we wanted to display the image the top level would permit us to do that.

46
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:59,620
Then we also have also publicly as found which would actually let us customize the name of the file.

47
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,380
So you see the stop publicly simply hushes a name and gives to us.

48
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,260
But the public the US simply gives us the possibility of passing on them.

49
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,100
So it looks like this is what we want.

50
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,020
So start publicly us he's going to store it on a discreet public visibility in a very simple way for

51
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,410
us.

52
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:22,670
So we're going to see major cross requests M.H. because that's the name we are using in our form and

53
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,150
as a public it us and we need to pass in the path and the name.

54
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,630
Right.

55
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,590
So let's pass in a bath.

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:36,510
We simply wanted to being a series of a tree and the name should maybe be strings SLOC of the request

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,190
title.

58
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:37,770
Right.

59
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,460
We're going to get back to this in a short while but I just want this to work.

60
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,060
And we're going to customize this the way it's supposed to be.

61
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,630
OK.

62
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,440
So we're passing in a name right here on the directory We want to see if that then we need to quit the

63
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,310
series right.

64
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,850
So let's just say serious great passing on a rate of title.

65
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:00,480
It's going to be request title description which is going to be request description and we have to take

66
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,150
care of this image.

67
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,830
You are so field.

68
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,040
So I'm just going to see you are off now.

69
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:07,930
OK.

70
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,550
Then they use lots of peach to see our series.

71
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,200
So return redirect Mike just for now.

72
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:16,790
OK.

73
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,440
We're going to be coming back to customized days later on.

74
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,670
But what we want to do is try to see this walking.

75
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,450
And I think this is going to break.

76
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,940
Let's just go ahead and try it out and see what we get.

77
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,830
Let's import CBS then.

78
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,850
That's our.

79
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,090
We need to make sure we talk about forms of sodomy to the right to out.

80
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,380
So let's see our rock list.

81
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:42,330
So let's see what the East looks like the name for the post is serious that's all.

82
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:49,950
So let's go ahead and make sure that this points to sou'west that strong squad routs series that's tall

83
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:56,820
and will provide a token our case so let's try this out and see what we get with fresh new series of

84
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,310
Lauda found description and creature.

85
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,770
And we have an integrity constraint volition under SLOC.

86
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:09,180
And I think that's my forte because we're trying to create a series without Potsie and those SLOC.

87
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,630
Right.

88
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,630
So we have to make sure we pass in a slog right here.

89
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,990
But looks like the image of Lord was utterly successful.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We're going to check that out in a moment.

91
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:24,940
So request title strength's law that squarehead and check disk to see if we actually had an email that

92
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,610
says store each public we have a series directory and we have new series right here.

93
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,250
But we don't have the extension right so that's what I was talking about right here.

94
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,660
But looks like it blows pretty well and we're going to take care of the extension very soon.

95
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,570
So let's make sure this works and then we'll take care of these little new series again.

96
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,630
FLATOW Lord description great series.

97
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,680
OK so we're redirected back to the speech.

98
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,220
Seems like everything worked perfectly.

99
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,580
So now why don't we take care of all the image off in the next video.
