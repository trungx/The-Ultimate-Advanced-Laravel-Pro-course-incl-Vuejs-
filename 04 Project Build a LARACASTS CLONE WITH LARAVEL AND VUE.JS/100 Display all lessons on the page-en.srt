1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,060
We also had our get out lessons.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:10,280
So we're going to use that method now to display all the lessons and display them in the correct order.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,040
OK.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,120
So I'm just going to create a column two of them.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:26,250
And this really bootstrapped for stylings and I'll create an on that list with list book class and I'm

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,470
going to use my four each right here.

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:37,210
So for each and for each remember we passed in the series into this view.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:45,350
So for each series get all the adolescents this current lesson.

9
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,230
OK.

10
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,060
So we're just going to use a different variable names such that we don't have any conflicts that will

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:01:01,460
create a list item with the ID of list group item and for each of this would simply first of all call

12
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,800
it the name.

13
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,280
OK.

14
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,830
So what's the current lesson title.

15
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:08,490
OK.

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,930
So that sounds strange.

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,390
I'm just going to use how to present.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,840
So arrow title.

19
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,450
Great.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,510
So let's go ahead and check this out.

21
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,670
I refresh.

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,650
We have the introduction to VGX.

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,720
What is Kostikov us view into view out the introduction.

24
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:32,880
Now if I were to head over to all my civis and added This is my maybe since I WANT MY seen.

25
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,290
I want to talk about this first.

26
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,160
So maybe I did this to 200.

27
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:47,760
So that this place first and then added this to 300 so that this place next and I read trash automatically

28
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,530
You see we have that order right here.

29
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,440
OK.

30
00:01:52,490 --> 00:02:00,170
One more thing I want to talk about is we can also check which one is plain and display and I can here

31
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:06,350
as you see this is the current And we can also have links right here so we can actually change all of

32
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,490
these two links.

33
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,540
And the title is actually going to be able to visit that particular course lesson.

34
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,110
OK.

35
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:23,750
So we can Ecorse the page or the route to watch this particular lesson which is going to be this route.

36
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:33,760
So while it's serious that watch remember repassing passing in the series which is serious

37
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:45,110
SLOC repassing in lesson which is now ID.

38
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,140
OK.

39
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,790
So when the user clicks on that you should actually visit that page to watch that lesson.

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,830
Refresh and have those links.

41
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:03,470
So if I click on this it takes me to and three click on this it takes me to lesson too.

42
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,680
And this one also takes me to Lesson one.

43
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,520
So everything seems to be working.

44
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,530
Thank you so much.

45
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,360
See you in the very next episode.
