1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,890
Okay the next couple of years are just going to be some little clean up stuff we need to do in our application.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:10,620
Nothing serious but little changes that are really going to help us optimize stuff like that.

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:16,750
So the first thing I want to do is head over to my notes see that view and I'm going to change the information

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,640
we have now.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,160
It was a very good learning experience.

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,130
Bert I don't think it's the best if we want to use it in production.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:32,350
So I'm going to move the template and we installed sweet alerts after he created this component.

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:39,780
So I'm just going to get Strega alert for him straight on Lerche OK.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,220
And whenever this notification is triggered this event is triggered.

10
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:54,220
I'm simply going to see street alerts and the message is going to be payload the message therefore we

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,290
no longer need our computer properties.

12
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,210
We also do not need this data.

13
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,850
I'm not complaining just barged down to a subscription.

14
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,140
So once a component is created it subscribes to that event and everything events in its fight or the

15
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,830
event is triggered or fired.

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,070
We have our suit on the displacer message.

17
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,530
OK so my love makes is running compiled all the assets.

18
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,590
Let me refresh the page.

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,100
It a recipe.

20
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,310
And if I click on Save lesson we have street right here.

21
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,100
That's the lesson of the to successfully isolates the same lessons and each successfully.

22
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:38,540
So we just reached out on those actions implementation with street light which I think it's great.

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,820
OK so that's the first thing that we've cleaned up.

24
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,200
The next thing I want to clean is my web ph be in the last lesson for the card update.

25
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:54,810
We actually put it in occlusions So let's just go ahead and create our controller for this so we can

26
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,700
call it a big cock controller.

27
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:06,930
So here we are CRN make controller or actually we should we can put this in its own method in the peripherals

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,800
controller.

29
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:16,450
So why don't I cut this out and then I'm going to remove disclosure and see if you'd use the PUFAs controller.

30
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,500
It's a big card meathook.

31
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,030
OK.

32
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:28,560
So hello to my PUFAs controller and who create the OBD-II Cardman thought and I'll paste in what I had

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,880
from the occlusal exactly the same thing.

34
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,500
OK.

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:44,780
So far a little validation we can say this validates the request object and passing Strype token is

36
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,420
required like that.

37
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,550
OK so we've moved that mid-thought into our control or on our web the PSP looks clean right now.

38
00:02:53,730 --> 00:03:00,180
And the one thing I want to clean up is in my profound lead that BHB I want to make sure that only the

39
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,700
authenticated user can view this in his profile.

40
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:09,630
So meaning every use I can receive and that they use a spoofer so they know the user's ID or they use

41
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,050
a user name right.

42
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,670
Bert the form for the team don't use those details which is this right here should only be displayed

43
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,140
if the authenticated users to one visit in his profile.

44
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:32,640
So I'm going to see if say orthe user ID equals user ID and I'm going to put it right here because this

45
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,190
profile we are posting to use up just like you or we would suspect for our work here.

46
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,870
Our country our first one then we have the authenticated user.

47
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,970
So we checked to make sure that the user is the one we will follow up and we can then display the details

48
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,950
for the use of two or bts details like that.

49
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,510
OK.

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,850
So there we go.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,450
And I think that is going to actually clean up a lot of areas for example maybe a user visiting another

52
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,520
person's will cannot get it right and right in this form.

53
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:13,140
Another thing I want to update is the subscriptions for the use are so right though at the bottom if

54
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,450
these others will have a plan this is going to give us an error.

55
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,180
OK.

56
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:26,520
So what we could do is actually wrap this in an instrument that says if you use your subscription first

57
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,400
then and if now we can paste this in like this.

58
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,780
OK.

59
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,980
So this is OK.

60
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,500
And it's not going to make multiple queries to our database because we are already eagerly loading the

61
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,240
subscriptions for the user.

62
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:48,990
But what we could do is actually save all of this subscription in available and we just simply assess

63
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,110
it.

64
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:56,190
So I'm just going to put subscription right here and in my control right here when you're passing the

65
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:03,750
use on the series I'm going to pass with subscription and right at the top before the beginning of this

66
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,830
block where the user can view his Digital's.

67
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:15,630
I'm going to say open ph B and close BHB and subscription is going to be called to the authenticated

68
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,600
users first subscription.

69
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,240
OK.

70
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:25,250
So right down here I would check if the user has a subscription then display this.

71
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,770
So rather than all of these will just switch this out to subscription try plan.

72
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:40,680
OK then we can have an else and then and if and right here we'll just see span that barge.

73
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,440
That barge danger which is just going to say no plan.

74
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,370
Okay.

75
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,290
Makes sense.

76
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:53,760
This is following security such that the user would be able to see this message if there is no subscription

77
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,370
for him.

78
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:54,970
OK.

79
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,490
And we can do exactly the same thing write down here.

80
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:04,130
So if the user those have a cot we don't want to even display the form.

81
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,100
OK so I'll just cut this out and see if I can use.

82
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,190
And for example cardboard and which means it's not now.

83
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:21,240
I can base this in and we can do exactly the same check with the link right here.

84
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:32,590
So the link to see the cards Ito's we can see if Arthur use our card brand and if no paystub.

85
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,950
OK so would only see the card details being when the user has a card.

86
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:42,730
I would also see the details to of the card only if the user actually has a card makes sense.

87
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,030
So these are little things that are going to prevent an altercation.

88
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,560
And I think that's pretty good so far.

89
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,540
So thank you so much and see you in the next video.
