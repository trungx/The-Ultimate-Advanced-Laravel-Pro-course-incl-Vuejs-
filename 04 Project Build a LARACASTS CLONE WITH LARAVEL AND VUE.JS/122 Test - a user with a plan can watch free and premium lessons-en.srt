1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:06,380
One math test before we move on I want us to assert that a user on the planet can actually watch any

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,510
sorts of video whether it's real or it's real.

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:17,420
So what can it create a new test for that and that test is going to see us use our on any plan kid watch

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,390
all lessons our kids.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,020
So what do we need for the stress we need to use.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,930
We need a lesson which is preview.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,570
We also need a lesson which is free and we need to log in news or some just get a copy of this suit

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,300
right there.

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,820
And next we need to make a request to the premium lesson.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,780
I would also make a request to the freelance so to get this.

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:43,940
But remember we want this user to actually have a subscription so we're going to fake the subscription.

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,980
So we're going to call this fake subscriber and pass in the user object.

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,490
OK.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,730
So this week subtribe is such a this me thought that we created a couple of lessons ago which is going

15
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,380
to fake a subscription for our user.

16
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,040
OK.

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,250
So this is what we have.

18
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,900
We have a user and we have two lessons.

19
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,770
One is premium and one is free and it'll be lots of different series but it doesn't really matter.

20
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:14,510
Then we also locked in the zone and then we subscribe that user to plan which is the yearly plan and

21
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:21,610
then we actually try to visit the pre-meal lesson and what you do is assert that when we try to visit

22
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:27,230
a premium lesson with the use of our subscribers we should actually visit the watch that made the.

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,830
Meaning that the user can watch it.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,890
And when we try to visit a free lesson the user should also be able to watch it make sense.

25
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:41,270
Let's go ahead and one that says between it foods or to the SEST OK great we have a direct pass because

26
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,390
we already took care of that in our control.

27
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:50,150
But right now we're very sure that no matter what plan a user is on he can watch Will lessons he can

28
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:57,600
watch free lessons as well but without a plan cannot watch him lessons he can only watch free lessons

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,680
and in case he wants to assess the lesson he's automatically redirected to the SUBSCRIBE beach so he

30
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,170
can get a subscription.
