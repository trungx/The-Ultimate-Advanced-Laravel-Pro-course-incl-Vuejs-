1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,230
Let's do a little bit of clean up interviews and what I'm talking about is revisit our sou'west the

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:14,570
blade that we we have eve our fuse or if our user has started a series on of these kind of statements.

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,160
OK.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:22,010
Now what I want to do is I don't want to have such but then I want to use the custom blade directives

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,830
that apply to us.

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,070
So label this as a possibility of quitting.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,010
What we constantly debate shifts and we use them however we want.

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,120
So first of all I'm going to clean this up and I'm going to use ief Earth.

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,460
And this is a big if that law applies to us.

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:44,340
So and us and if we go ahead or Voser we still have the same thing.

11
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,910
So this looks a little bit cleaner.

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,080
Then how about cleaning this up.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,340
If the user has started a series now they're going to create a custom bleet if Sigmon or blade directive

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,310
and we're going to use it in our views.

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,660
So our head of much of my apps service provider and this is where we can actually register some of your

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,150
stuff.

17
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,840
So after our level has finished registering all the service providers it's going to call this boot method

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,900
so we can actually create our own custom bleet if Stedman Rakia.

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,210
So how do we create this.

20
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,710
We have the blade Fassett we have an IV method.

21
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,730
So I'm gonna use the blade Fosi right here.

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,800
So on this if mid-thought it's 6 in the name of the directory if we want to use.

23
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:35,450
So I'm going to call it has started this and the Prometa it takes in like here is a function occlusal.

24
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,940
So that's the second Parminter and the pomander that is passed into disclosure or is the parameter that

25
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,580
we can pass into this blate the next year.

26
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,040
OK.

27
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:51,380
So for example if we have it has started seaways then we can pass in upon it right here.

28
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,290
For example the series itself the instance of the series.

29
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:01,550
So if we pass in that parameter for our views it's automatically getting passed into disclosure so we

30
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:08,420
can receive the series right here and right here we just need to return a boolean so we can return our

31
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,850
use on and then we can call the house started series marathon.

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,870
And sure enough into this mid-thought we need to pass in the series.

33
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,910
So that's all we need to create our own custom bleet directive.

34
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,240
Now let's go ahead and learn how to use this.

35
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:29,440
So rather than seeing if all news has started this we are simply going to see how US US.

36
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,040
I will pass in the U.S. and then else.

37
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,670
And then we're going to see and start as soon as.

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,280
That's it.

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,780
Okay.

40
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:48,290
So we don't at least no more Hostetter series display continue learning else just start learning and

41
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,070
has started sou'west looks very clean.

42
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,620
Okay.

43
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:58,110
So let's refresh and we get the exact same thing which means obliterates is working perfectly.
