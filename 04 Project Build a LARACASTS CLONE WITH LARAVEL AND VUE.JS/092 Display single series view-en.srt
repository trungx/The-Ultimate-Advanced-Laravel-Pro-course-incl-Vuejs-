1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,440
Come back we have a landing page we have a series on each.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,500
But what about a single page to view our CBEST independency.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,650
Let's go ahead and take care of this.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,230
In my Front-End and control actually actually studied the for.

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,650
We're going to really start a new world where we can view a single series alone.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,480
OK.

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,080
So watch.

8
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:28,310
It's going to be a gets and it's going to be serious and we're taking the series.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:34,780
I remember I'm using series right here because I want to make use of Slavoj route model by then and

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:43,770
I'm going to see get to the front and control law and will get the series method.

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:44,830
OK.

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:52,960
So in our front end control would create a serious thought and to receive the series we're just going

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,130
to typings series and love automatically inject that into this method for us then we can just focus

14
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,860
on returning a view.

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:08,850
And in this case we tend to view quite serious and go past in the series that we just got is

16
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,110
awesome.

17
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:18,020
So now that we have that mid-thought in our resources views that actually we need a series that they

18
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,510
appear to be right and they just created want to save us a lot of time.

19
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,730
So I don't want us to go through the process of creating some ex-chairman and stuff like that.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,340
OK.

21
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:35,860
So here it's simply a header and then some content very minimal and we're going to go for it.

22
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:42,550
So for the header I want to change the background styling that we have here to the Sui's image.

23
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:52,940
So rather than having these I'm going to call out series image path and I'm actually using the attribute

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,190
set.

25
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,780
So right down here I think we have an image path for me.

26
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,560
There we go.

27
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,180
OK.

28
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,040
So serious image is going to give us the background image.

29
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,150
The next thing we want is the title.

30
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:16,060
So with a quote Series title and we also do that here then now we have a start learning button.

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,940
So what we can do is check if

32
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,520
you zone.

33
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:31,810
So if the user has authenticated then we're going to check if the user has started that series so we

34
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:47,250
can see if the user has started serious on passing Sui's then we see House and with half and Eve.

35
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,060
OK.

36
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:54,970
So we checked if they use us authenticated and if it's authenticated then we can have the check for

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,350
if he has started the series.

38
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,880
So if he has started the series then we're going to have a continual engine box.

39
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,400
And rather than start nothing.

40
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,080
OK.

41
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,600
So continue on your learning and we can actually make this link two different pages.

42
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,100
We cannot talk about that later.

43
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,100
Then we're going to have start learning if he has not completed or he has not started the service.

44
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:22,230
OK then if the user is not authentic he said then we're simply going to see.

45
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,960
Show us start learning bottom.

46
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,460
OK so the use authenticated.

47
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,060
We're going to check if he has suffered the series and if they use it as another indicator we're simply

48
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,790
going it's me a start learning button.

49
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:39,940
Ok then finally we have the cause description which we can quote here.

50
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:48,370
And for the video lessons we are simply going to have an on that list which switching committee carefully

51
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:48,630
Tom.

52
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,090
OK.

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,220
So let's just squarehead and see what we get.

54
00:03:51,220 --> 00:04:00,940
Now in our home page we want to link to that route so I'll head over to my Welkom that blade and right

55
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,500
down where we have I will read more.

56
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:12,490
I'm going to link this to all routes and this is going to be series I will pass in the series SLOC.

57
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,180
OK.

58
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:19,490
So in my web ph be I mean just give this a name of serious.

59
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:25,890
OK so looks like we get to go refresh rigmarole.

60
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:33,860
Undefined variable cost description that should be in our series that blate So in our description series.

61
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,180
I'm so sorry about that.

62
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,150
OK.

63
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,440
So refresh.

64
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:37,740
Great.

65
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,490
So we have the background image the title of the series and then Sing's This user has actually started

66
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,500
learning how behalf continual learning.

67
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:55,990
Barton now we have the series description OK great so we have a single page for a single service.
