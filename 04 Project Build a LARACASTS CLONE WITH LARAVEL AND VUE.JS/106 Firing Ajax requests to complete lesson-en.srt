1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,110
This father we have four components that are components and alerts to the user that he's finished watching

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,750
the video.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:13,410
But before that's what we want to do is actually make an Ajax request to complete that NSN for the user

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,760
for that series.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,350
And then we display this message to the user.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:24,960
OK so that's quite a method called complete lesson on these components and this method is going to use

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,390
examples to fire that request.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,930
So let's import exudes.

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:29,730
OK.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,850
So just to review what the.

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,850
PH BE we have that post requests.

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,700
That completes the lesson and we need to pass in the lesson ID.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,090
We already tested this so we know it's working.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,570
So right here all we need to do is say XOs the post in the correct year.

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:55,440
I see this completely Assen and looks like we need to pass the lesson IDs so I'm going to change this

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,130
to back 6 so we can concatenate the lesson ID and then right here.

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,250
I'll just quote this.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,580
That lesson that ID.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,190
OK.

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,720
So that's the you know.

21
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:16,320
And then when you pass in the data for the spoors requests which is an empty object and Dan would say

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,550
that.

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,060
Then we receive a successful response from us.

24
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,160
What we want to do is now call our display video alert method.

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,800
OK.

26
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,280
So right here we're going to see this dot display video.

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,260
OK.

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:41,160
And then at the top in the wall mounted hook at the bottom when the player listens to and rather than

29
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,640
calling me already it's going to call this dot complete lesson.

30
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,330
OK.

31
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,520
So we listen to that event when the lesson is completed.

32
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,040
And once we hear that event we call a complete lesson mid-thought the complete lesson method as an Ajax

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,620
request to this point which is going to complete that lesson for I use.

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,180
And once that request is successful we call the display we do a lot more thought.

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,250
We just go into all the user you just completed the lesson or the Sui's.

36
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:08,990
OK.

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,050
So let's check this out in the browser.

38
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,910
I'm just going inspect right there.

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,050
Hard refresh.

40
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:23,130
And right now we haven't completed this lesson so I'm going to plate and phosphor that it's there and

41
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:29,860
so naturally fires that request and magically we see we have here you have completed this series.

42
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,990
So I click on OK and let's check out our network to see if any request was fire.

43
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,650
And right here we just call that the request was actually fired.

44
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,980
So I'm just going to expand this a little.

45
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,180
We have that request to the complete lesson for listen to and preview.

46
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,520
We have the status OK.

47
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,040
That was Sir responded to us.

48
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,510
OK.

49
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,660
So now I'm going to refresh this page and if you check out we have the complete set message right here

50
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,670
which means this lesson was completed.

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,280
OK.

52
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,060
So let's go ahead and also try to complete this video.

53
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,620
OK.

54
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:09,660
I'm going to play it fast for that and you see here we completed this lesson because he just of course

55
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,370
was fired.

56
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,240
That's the response if I click on OK it refreshes goes to the next.

57
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,670
But now all three have been completed.

58
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,160
OK.

59
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,160
So the completion starters for this series is 100 percent.

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,120
Great job.
