1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,810
OK let's get our fun.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,870
We're going to use AJAX for that.

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,090
Now if we took off form we have the safe and Button and we click on the chin and say stop the team because

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,910
that's what we have for now let's switch this out with our correct implementation.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,290
So Agios And the question we want to make is a push request.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,080
So now we need to pass on the endpoint.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,820
So we're going to be slash at mean slash the C C which we don't have yet because we might actually be

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,410
opening the lesson form when we don't see have this.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,180
So why don't we have to be parsed in the society as a people and also therefore with head of cattle

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,590
and lessens that view and rather than passing one parameter would pass in the lesson and the serious

11
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,100
idea.

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,820
OK so serious idea should be passed in and we'll just see that serious ID because they this up serious

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:51,440
ID.

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,250
OK.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,070
So we have this society that we could reference right here.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,470
OK.

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,960
So we pass in lesson and see sides in an object then what we could do is receive these properties right

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,340
here.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,550
So we'd have a lesson and a series ID.

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,920
We can now assign the series ID on this component.

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,690
Now we can make a request by passing in this that serious ID license and now we need access to the lessons.

22
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,710
So how do we do this.

23
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,190
So lets just default receiving saving the lesson ID on this class.

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:21,720
OK.

25
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,140
So lesson Id cause less than ID.

26
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,890
OK so we need to reference that onwards for that.

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:36,150
OK so now that we lucratively collaterally you just said the lesson or lesson from this that lesson

28
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:41,370
should be taught to lesson and that would actually remove the complexity of watching all of these properties

29
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,160
out.

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:48,590
Yeah but then we might actually Kombucha we frostily to but I'm going to go with this so we can reference

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,190
the ID by seeing the vase that lesson ID then its a regress.

32
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:59,100
We can listen to when the dentist fired on with just console that knock the response for now and would

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,520
catch and it was something we see from the server and console that know that response also.

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,610
So obviously we need to pass in the detail right.

35
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,790
So its going to look exactly like this.

36
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,320
So let's pass in title description a piece of number and your ID.

37
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,860
OK.

38
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,440
So let's try this out in the box and actually see if it walks and it click on the Save lesson button

39
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,280
and we have a successful response from our server.

40
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,590
So lets go ahead and try to edit something so edit it and save listen.

41
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,800
Check out the responses to see if the title was detat and looks like it works.

42
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,860
So updates is working perfectly.

43
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,270
Let's see if we could do a little refracts or in the very next video.
