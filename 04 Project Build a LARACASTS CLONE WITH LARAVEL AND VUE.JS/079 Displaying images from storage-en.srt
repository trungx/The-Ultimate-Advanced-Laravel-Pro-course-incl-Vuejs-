1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,820
I'd like us to start working on fun and a little bit.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,520
Now I have important played right here which I'm going to use to display the featured screen screencast

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,810
when it gets in the featured series.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:16,720
Yes but we want to actually just display a series from a database to the front end users.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,710
How are we going to be doing that.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,140
I have a template right here so we're going to get that data from the database.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,390
And that's really displayed.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:23,810
OK.

9
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,070
Now we're going to be talking more about images.

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,210
I like to start by creating a new controller that I'm going to call it free of.

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,360
Make the phones and.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,410
And all of those little vaults like the welcome page are going to be accessed from this controller.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,950
So if I head over to my web browser we have this Clozaril right here and I'm going to switch on right

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:51,690
now and I'm going to tell them to use the funds and controller and we use the welcome massage.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,730
Ok for the welcome page.

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:04,370
So LA and the welcome and this Welcomer thought simply returns the view welcome like before but now

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,280
we want to actually display some series right here.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,640
So what I want to do is I want to get all the Swiss on the database for now and then I'm going to meet

19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,860
all of them on the front page.

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,960
So we'll just see this view with see race.

21
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:30,280
I would get serious or OK then on this view would now have access.

22
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:36,520
So if I visit my welcome to the Ph.D. We can now have access to that collection.

23
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:45,520
Therefore I would look to all of the connection using of or else be favorably and would see Sui's as

24
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,850
maybe available less than what my friends are empty blog.

25
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,950
And and files.

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,840
So in this foil spots we can paste up templates.

27
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:07,230
And now let's just start by customizing the cost side so so get the series get the title and right.

28
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,250
Yeah we can actually just get the Sui's description.

29
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:10,860
OK.

30
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,010
So let's see how this looks.

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,190
Refresh OK.

32
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,960
So we have to see recent Abita is the best Lavoe costs and advanced with just beginners course.

33
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,820
So this is the description of Yousif to each of his.

34
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,890
Now let's talk about the images.

35
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,620
I'm going to show you something right here.

36
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,500
If I simply echo out the series you match your own.

37
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:40,350
Now we see with fresh you just that we actually saved the name of the fire without actually saving the

38
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:40,680
path.

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,400
Remember we agreed we can put it in the series.

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,060
But then that's a little like an obligation that I'm going to show you later.

41
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,470
But the right says to fix it.

42
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,290
And that is when we're updating the see which we don't actually concatenate the response.

43
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:53,900
Right.

44
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,400
OK.

45
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,870
We're going to take care of that later.

46
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,620
OK.

47
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,690
So how do we display this image from our storage.

48
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,090
Now first of all remember if you want to actually display an image from your storage directory then

49
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,950
that image has to be in a public disk.

50
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:09,720
OK.

51
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,670
So you have to make sure it's in the public debate tree in your store each directory.

52
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:20,170
So we have our story directory and we have app which is the default look disk.

53
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,460
And if you wanted to be visible to the public you have to put it in the public directory right here.

54
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,030
OK.

55
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,440
So the first thing that we're going to be doing is making sure that we actually save our images in the

56
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,460
public directory.

57
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,800
We are going to be taking care of in the next lesson.

58
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,080
And the second thing we want to make sure is we actually see if the correct path into our database which

59
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,070
we're also going to be doing that in the next lesson with our tests.

60
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,930
But for now we want to see how we can actually display the images that we have right now.

61
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:54,210
So the first thing you have to know display images from your store which it must be in the store is

62
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,650
public actually.

63
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:01,230
So I'll just move my series directory into the public directory just for now and the next thing I'm

64
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,660
going to do is I'm going to run a command the law will provide for us which is BHB artist and Stone

65
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,940
Age leg.

66
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,870
OK.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,040
And if you look at what these commandos he creates are stylish in public public the right here.

68
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,450
And most everything in that public directory to the public directory up here.

69
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:27,780
Now what happens now gives us the permission to display all of the files from the public directory as

70
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,600
easy as that.

71
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:34,770
So if you want that to display this image right here would head of what's where we have these assets

72
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,930
and would reference that fire.

73
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,440
Right.

74
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,890
So let's just see it will out.

75
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,210
I said my thought because the acid mid-thought assesses the assets from this public directory.

76
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:44,650
Right.

77
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,970
And we need to get into our storage in a treat and then we have a serious directory and that's where

78
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,090
we have the fire that has been seized.

79
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:58,740
So right here this is where we're going to concatenates with the Stone Age series.

80
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,160
You make your own.

81
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,010
OK.

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,100
So store each tree series than the series image you're on.

83
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,280
That's what we're going to have.

84
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,650
So let's refresh the page to see what we have.

85
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,410
Yeah it doesn't display anything.

86
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,240
Let's inspect to see what's going on.

87
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,040
And we have a series but cause this means we need a slush right here.

88
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:20,980
OK.

89
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,800
So let's refresh one more time.

90
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,900
There we go we have images display but this image is not just mean obviously because we don't have that

91
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,300
image in our system.

92
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:30,760
Right.

93
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,520
So we can actually display the images from our Stone Age but our system does not walk as a spectator.

94
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,060
We're actually just learning how to display from us each time a tree.

95
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:46,260
But we have to make sure that when we're saving the image into our storage the way we receive it into

96
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,320
the public now we're actually also so that we can access it using Petchey Alasan Strobridge link.

97
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,820
And we also have to make sure that we're be updating our series.

98
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,340
The image is actually updated on the correct path it's saved into the database.

99
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:00,890
OK.

100
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,750
So let's take of that the very next video.
