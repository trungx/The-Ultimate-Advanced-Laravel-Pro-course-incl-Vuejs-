1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:07,020
Like something imagine a situation where you're already enrolled into the series and you want to continue

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,130
learning but then the next lesson or the previous lesson you were you watched was last.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,350
And then you're trying to get the next lesson after the last squinched if you know.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:16,890
Right.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,300
But then you redirect to that beach.

6
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,720
It's just pop up on occasion.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,730
So what I want to do is customize our next and previous lesson mythos and we're going to be using our

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,720
test to do this.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,060
So remember when we were running the assertions Check out this I thought I mean just walking you remember

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,930
who created a lesson and created a second creature the third and then this one was the first one to

11
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,440
play in the play list.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,640
This is the second and this is the last one to play.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,700
But at the end we actually asserted that if we are trying to get the previous lesson for the first series

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,750
it should give us more.

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:57,940
And if we are trying to get the next lesson for the last series give us all but I want to change this.

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:05,920
I want to say we should actually check our search equals ID and we get less too easy.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,430
So if we are trying to get the previous lesson of the first series it doesn't give us the first series.

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:20,210
And if we are trying to get to the next lesson of the last series then you should naturally give us

19
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,510
the last lesson.

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,100
OK.

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,870
So the last lesson of this series then this year was the last lesson.

22
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,440
The first lesson of the submission was the first lesson because we don't want more.

23
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,030
OK.

24
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,480
And that's one test to see what happens at this point.

25
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,810
You know it's futile.

26
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:46,210
I started in and sure enough we ever feel the French get property of object because right here we're

27
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,490
trying to get idea of law at the moment.

28
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:54,610
So we're at the crux of this mid-thought and whether we do this is I'm going to see if next lesson available

29
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:01,620
for this query and then I'm going to check Wike here if the next lesson is no.

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,280
So if next lesson

31
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:13,960
so if we have a positive or two see value then simply return next lesson.

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,100
OK but then if we don't have a truly value Nietzsche was known then we would return this.

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,710
OK so when we send the lesson that we have to do exactly the same thing with our previous lesson method.

34
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:37,340
So previous lesson because this then what we do is we check if we have a previous lesson.

35
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,300
If we do then we simply return to this lesson.

36
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:51,600
And then if we don't we simply return this then let's run our test right now to see if it passes and

37
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,520
it does.

38
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,770
Therefore when we get the previous or next lesson we would never have know.

39
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,430
Now why do we do this.

40
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,250
I'll take to my learning controller.

41
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:06,980
I'm learning the PH BE traits and I'm going to show you that there are some that actually depend on

42
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,980
the next AMPAS less than my thoughts for example the last one at the bottom which is the get the next

43
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,270
lesson to watch.

44
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,550
See right here we get the next lesson.

45
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:23,810
So if this actually returns more and the way it gets in next lesson of now or this method actually returns

46
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,520
now and we're returning to the view it's really going to mess up our.

47
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,000
Therefore we always want to make sure we have something for the usal.
