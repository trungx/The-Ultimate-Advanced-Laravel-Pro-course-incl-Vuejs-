1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,040
Are like this to go street you naturally start to make use of a vacation.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,480
So I want to shoot an email to the user as soon as Chris and I count and we're not going to give him

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,240
access to anything until he actually confirms his e-mail address.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,080
Now let's just go ahead and use a test to bring this functionality so we have to actually think about

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,310
what we want to implement.

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,240
So as an e-mail he sends to newly registered users.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,550
OK so how would we want to know.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,800
Let's just see which stuff you use.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,660
And then we assert that a particular e-mail was sent.

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,890
That's all going to be doing.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,060
So stop a question and use up or actually registering a user which means I'm going to be visiting my

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,710
endpoints.

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,750
So basically isn't.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,930
So as soon as the user is I'm start to assert that mail was sent.

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,580
So looks like we're going to be meeting our middle seat from now on.

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:55,070
And what are we going to be doing is actually seeing Lovelle please switch out and Millward rival and

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,230
give us a fake.

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,480
And if we want to actually know what these feet methadose let's have much more with that PSP which is

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,530
lunette support for seats and actually see that we have this week met.

20
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,830
And most of the proceeds will actually have this fee method.

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,530
So it simply swapping the old regional mail handler with a fake We're getting it from support system

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:16,990
fix.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,960
So what's more fake all the magic happens.

24
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,930
And what is simply going to do is send in messages.

25
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,860
It's not going to do that.

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,740
So for example if we check out a Senate vote on this morphic last what is up and NE's chasing the view

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,880
that we have to send data on a callback.

28
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,700
And then what it does is simply pushes the view that we passed into a millibars.

29
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,440
Are we right.

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,540
It's not sending emails at all.

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,600
So what is going to happen is if we call us sense mid-thought it's going to check if the view of the

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,240
millibar that we passed into the I said since mid-thought actually exists on the Malibu's are we right.

33
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,040
OK.

34
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,540
So let's go ahead and use this so much attrition we fiqh them a lot.

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,750
So it's going to swap out and the most of me.

36
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,610
And then right here we can call us at St..

37
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,820
So M. assert that a mail was sent and the name of this e-mail is going to be confirmed.

38
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,390
Your email last.

39
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,530
OK so for now let's just make sure that this e-mail is sent.

40
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,710
Now let's just run that test expected to confirm your e-mail mailable was not sent right so filled such

41
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,290
false is true.

42
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,380
Let's send this email on how are we going to do that.

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,860
That said to you John registration.

44
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,820
And we're going to take a look at what happens at this event new we saw saw history.

45
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,040
And that's also a registar method.

46
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,180
And these were just them or just like authenticates at mid-thought.

47
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,810
It's a simple gives us to do something once the registration is complete.

48
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,610
So let's head what's all rigid Stoss are going to override this method.

49
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,890
So right down here I'm going to paste nothing.

50
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,390
And what they want to actually do is make sure that I also redirect after I'm done with that method.

51
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,810
Right because now we're going to call this method and then it's going to be that way for us.

52
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:11,030
So you know register all of us for everything I need to do make sure I return this redirect path.

53
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,870
So this is where I'm going to be sending my e-mails so mail send.

54
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,610
And before we actually call to send mid-thought Let's call the two men thought to pass in this use object

55
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:26,460
and we're receiving to a user who just got we just got into this my thought so now to this user send

56
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,240
a new that's had much of what's asked.

57
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,910
And Michel we had the same e-mail.

58
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,250
So new you confirm your email mailable.

59
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,190
So you bought that.

60
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:42,060
And I know it's going to break because we don't yet have that loss but let's let access to us that.

61
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,660
But the BBC was actually not helpful.

62
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:50,130
So what are we going to do is simply attach and US-CERT redirects to this myth up right here and lovely's

63
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,740
of how much can actually fit with this test and then tell us what is going on.

64
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,080
So let's try that and see his response to US 500.

65
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,560
It's not a redux That's a school at 500.

66
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,310
So we need to just.

67
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,200
Exception handling so we can see what the 500 is all about.

68
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,100
OK.

69
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,210
Run that again.

70
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,890
And there we have our role.

71
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,970
It seems like women want us to there we just thought must be an instance of oh I'm sorry.

72
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,390
That should be because we haven't imported this at the top.

73
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,300
Let's go ahead and make sure we do so.

74
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:26,280
So use Lumi S2P request one that again.

75
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:26,870
OK.

76
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,800
Now it's also she can find that confirm email.

77
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,950
So let's go ahead and read that we are sent mail confirm your e-mail.

78
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,950
And while I'm here I'm just going to generate a map down you for that.

79
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,940
So it's going to be e-mails that confirm your e-mail but let that be.

80
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,560
And I like that convention where this actually matches your name.

81
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:54,030
OK so that's one that milkweeds that let's make sure we actually import the class at the top before

82
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,180
calling our test again.

83
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:56,880
OK.

84
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:05,150
So you know at M. tree sure enough we have this so use our mail actually but costs me to confirm your

85
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,810
e-mail.

86
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,650
Let's run that test again.

87
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,950
And now this is an error seen first feature confirm your e-mail was not sent.

88
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,410
OK.

89
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:17,220
So that's because we have also imported these in our test.

90
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,540
Right.

91
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,620
So let's go ahead and do that now.

92
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,760
Had a lot of my restrictions on us and used up at the top.

93
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,490
One that says it again and great looks like we have a successful test this time around.

94
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,700
So we are actually sending a user an e-mail every time he's registered right.

95
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,790
Do you use actually an e-mail to confirm his e-mail address.

96
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,010
But what about the underlying functionality that goes reconfirming e-mail addresses.

97
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,890
Let's tackle that in the next lesson.
