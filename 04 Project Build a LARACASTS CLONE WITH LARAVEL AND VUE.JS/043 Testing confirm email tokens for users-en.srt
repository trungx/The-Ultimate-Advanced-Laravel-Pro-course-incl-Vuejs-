1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,890
That's such a you make a confirmation e-mail system work.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,410
So we want to actually see if we're talking on the users table that belongs to the user not just where

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,150
you start.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,940
And then if the user clicks on a link in his email then we're going to remove that token and then we're

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,540
going to have a middleware that checks if the users conform to Tcl is still in his database column.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,310
So if it's not law then it means that user has not yet confirmed.

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,340
So let's go ahead and take care of it.

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,340
We thought that we might actually decide to stop too fast.

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,280
So let's go ahead and do that public function test or use has it all.

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,180
Can I salvage trillion.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,300
OK so let's just start with this.

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,750
We need to just use.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,100
Right.

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,620
So we're going to just fix the middle so it doesn't trigger the Confirm e-mail meal then right here

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,890
we're going to see this syrup Motson or for the use or confirm talken.

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,270
Right.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,340
So we going to reference a user on the User class and make sure that it's not load because if it doesn't

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,570
exist then it's going to be No.

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,160
Right.

20
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,340
So I said that it's NOT.

21
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,440
Let's go ahead and run this test and see what we have just for a start.

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,620
I think we can do so feel towards you.

23
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,490
The new test my thought we have a message on Friday we will use our and this use of that we actually

24
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,490
are referencing here is the use of that was just Queechy it and we're going to get the use of by simply

25
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,360
fetching the first user.

26
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,200
Right because we are using the refresh database and it's going out to metrically refresh and create

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,910
a new use.

28
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,410
Once we have to gather for each user.

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,070
Now right here and all that.

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,320
So use but cost use zong.

31
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,530
Now let's head over to our seminar on tests and we have filled a search in that no it's not no.

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,400
Now then I'm always forced to make this property exist under use or clause.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,620
We could just create a property but then I think I'm just going to go ahead and solve the problem because

34
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,720
we know what we need.

35
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,350
So head over to my queries of Steamboat and how much are you going to create a string field which is

36
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,690
going to be from Tolkien and I'm going to make sure it's not the rule book because I want to make it

37
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,610
all about when these are confirmed seats.

38
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,540
Eamon OK now that I've done that it's still not going to pass.

39
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:17,070
Let's head over to our registar our and you fill that field wants to use our registar so confirm talken

40
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,030
should be close to streambed random 10:5 contest.

41
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,310
Matsue show this is the name of the help of my father I will provide for us but we're going to see.

42
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,350
OK so generic 25:1 on card us store when confronted can field of the database.

43
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,860
And finally you know I use other B we need to make sure that level permits that field to be filled.

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,040
So that's one test one more time and see what we have.

45
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,270
OK so we have a successful test.

46
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:51,150
So it means we actually generating in disconfirm talking and inserting it into the database at registration

47
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,890
time.

48
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,930
Now now another assertion that I want to I try to run right here is just an assertion to make sure we

49
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,060
have help from my father.

50
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,290
Tell us if they use or is confirmed or not.

51
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:09,090
So I'm just going to see a assert false use or he's confirmed and I'll call this awesome method.

52
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,200
Let's run let's see what we have.

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,700
We actually have on the Find My thought is confirmed this is what we expected.

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,220
And you know we use the b b.

55
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:23,460
We're going to have this is going from mid-thought probably function is confirmed won the game and then

56
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,620
it sees fit as such and that is false because we truly nothing at the moment.

57
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,860
So which we cannot see which on this confirm so come across.

58
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,750
OK.

59
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:42,420
So you can Fonzo can it's more than we're going to see the use I can find because at which time we actually

60
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,800
few in this field.

61
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,040
Then if the user confirms himself then we're going to pull out the token and then make sure it's long.

62
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,530
OK.

63
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,200
So let's run this test again.

64
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,880
I should pass it right now and he does that for actually having our confirm right here.

65
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:04,260
Now what I would love to do is actually make sure that our e-mail order we are fairing contains the

66
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,930
token for the user right.

67
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,790
So we have to confirm your e-mail that bid may be a tree.

68
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,680
And this is simply above me level.

69
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:19,630
So we're just going to see one more step before join back cast and this is going to be.

70
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,490
We need you to confirm your e-mail and this is you can see confirm email and we're going to see thanks.

71
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,480
Config aptonym.

72
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:34,040
So let's just actually take this opportunity to change the name of the BHB in the configurator tree.

73
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,910
And here we have an app name that's just changed in that EMV.

74
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,570
So I'm going to change my theme park costs and that's you all to feel into the email please.

75
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,150
OK.

76
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,030
So we need these buttons actually click and take us some way.

77
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,860
And this is where we are actually going to verify to use on.

78
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,070
So I'm going to do it just yet.

79
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,660
But one final thing before we go we let's just take this opportunity to actually use one of Laufman

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,940
news future and that's actually on on the balls and the puzzle to see if this changes that we made that

81
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,980
really took effect.

82
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:13,350
So what headbutts or what the PH We were simply going to swap this out for now and we're going to return

83
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,360
the mailable.

84
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,760
So we turn new broadcasts merely confirm your email and let's see what we get.

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,240
So visit the home page and looks like what emotion is good enough right.

86
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,870
So we have seen one more step before we joined but cost we need to confirm your email.

87
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,130
And that's our motto on that.

88
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,850
Awesome.

89
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,770
So looks like everything works perfectly.

90
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,730
Thank you so much.

91
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,070
We're got to take care of actually confirming to you as you know in the next video.
