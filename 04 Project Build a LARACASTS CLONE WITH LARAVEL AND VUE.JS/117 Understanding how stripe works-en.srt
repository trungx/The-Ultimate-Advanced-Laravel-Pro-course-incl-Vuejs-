1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:06,540
Having a subscription based application with a cashier it's really easy level cashier takes care of

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,820
most of the work behind the scenes.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:14,910
So for example let's go ahead and look and look at how we can subscribe a user to a new subscription.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,030
All we need to do like in the documentation like your is find a user and then on the user we call the

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:27,100
new subscription mid-thought we pass in the name of the subscription and then we also pass in the name

6
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,590
of the subscription on our stripe dashboard and then we call that creates mid-thought and we pass in

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,830
the token.

8
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,750
That's all we need to create a subscription but then look at this talken right here.

9
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,370
Where is it coming from.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,990
What is that token.

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,990
This brings us to understanding how strike works.

12
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,810
And this is what they're going to be covering in this lesson to understand how Strype works.

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,570
We're going to start by checking out our dashboard.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,510
And before we are able to use subscriptions you need to come to your subscription stop.

15
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,770
And then we need to go to our plans and then you need to create some plans.

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,360
OK.

17
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:06,940
So when you quit discipline's that's when you'll be able to call or pass these ID right here all the

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,720
identifier of the plan and then automatically subscribe to use or to that plan.

19
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,150
OK.

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,570
So do you plan or you just need today's Can-Can plan right here.

21
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,060
And then you put in the GITTOES.

22
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,220
So for example right you have a new plan that they call monthly.

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,830
So the idea is monthly.

24
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,510
The name is just monthly what I want to see on my dashboard and I said the price to nine dollars and

25
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,980
there's no trial period.

26
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,580
I also have a yearly if you check out the yearly I have an ID.

27
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,410
I have a name on there and I have the price for $99 year.

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,080
OK.

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:46,420
So that said once you set up the plans what happens is Strype needs to take in the user credentials

30
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,130
charge the card and then automatically it's going to set up a recruitment payment charge on that card.

31
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,570
OK.

32
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:59,770
So if you passing a card and you told Strype subscribe the card to this monthly plan every month is

33
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,110
going to charge you use are mindless.

34
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,760
But then if you subscribe to the yearly every year you subscribe to ninety nine dollars.

35
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,350
OK.

36
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:14,510
So the question that still remains is how the reports in the Strype took in the strike took them so

37
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,840
representation of the use us.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,910
Remember our data base is not going to contain any credit card numbers or any expiry dates for us credit

39
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,030
card numbers.

40
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:32,260
But it's going to contain an identifier for that particular use in our data in our database.

41
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:32,630
OK.

42
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:40,540
We're going to be looking at it but what happens is we pass the credit card information to Strype by

43
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:47,350
an API call and then Strype is going to return to us a striped token when we get a striped token passing

44
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:54,190
into this method and then Lovelle cashier is when you make another API calls the Strype to coo yeards

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,040
that subscription.

46
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,520
OK.

47
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,140
So how do we get the use of credit cards or Strypes with us Tricon returns was destroyed took in less

48
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,470
checkout Strype documentation.

49
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,770
So remember the procedure.

50
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,020
First we take our users credit card.

51
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,440
We send it to stripe.

52
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:17,060
She's going to convert this credit card encryption and all of that stuff into a token.

53
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,980
So a string so a string representation of the credit card so that it's very secure.

54
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,670
It's going to give us about that stream.

55
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:30,190
It would give the street level cashier level cashier would pass in the string back to Strype and then

56
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,900
it's going to pass in the name of the plan and make sure the name of the plan is also a plan that you

57
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,980
created right here.

58
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,290
And then third is going to subscribe to the plan and then charge the user.

59
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,920
OK.

60
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,750
So how do we get the credit card and then send it to right.

61
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,480
We need to use checkout.

62
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,500
So in your novel and your Strype Doc's visit payments and then visit checkout and then you can go to

63
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,300
reference and what reference when you do it's going to teach us how to integrate this tripe checkout.

64
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:04,240
So if I visit for example this link right here and I click on the page with card you see we have this

65
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,410
region that pops up.

66
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,980
We can put in the use ID then the credit card is the most important why are we passing the credit cards.

67
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,310
And they would say pay 20 dollars.

68
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,670
This is going to create.

69
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,760
So can this token right here and then it's going to return it to us.

70
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,780
And then once that is returned to us we can now send it to level cashier and allow lot cash is going

71
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:31,670
to subscribe that you are using that token which is a representation of these credit card details.

72
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,230
OK.

73
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:39,540
So now would be to get this functionality on our phones and to make it work.

74
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,690
That's right some of us in the very next episode.
