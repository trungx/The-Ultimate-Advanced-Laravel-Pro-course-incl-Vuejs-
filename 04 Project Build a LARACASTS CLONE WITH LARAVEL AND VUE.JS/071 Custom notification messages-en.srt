1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:07,240
Not want a lot of console that locks all about application and there that's not really going to be a

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,600
very helpful notification system in production.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,330
So what are they going to be doing in this video.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,540
It's actually creating our own custom detection system as you know just to be using notifications all

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,040
around application of different components.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,750
And the best way to go about it is actually registering an events bus on in the object so we can access

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,480
it from anywhere at any time.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,440
I'll show what I mean.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:34,930
I'll head over to view and in my app the Jets right here we have the window objects and we can actually

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,370
registar different properties on this object.

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,130
And I'm just going to start with a naughty property which is going to be a function that takes in a

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,460
notification and let's just see if we start when you call this mid-thought.

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,580
It's simply a console that locks notification not message.

14
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:55,360
OK so because I'm thinking and this question should be made up of a message and a type so maybe it's

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,650
a success or a danger type or warning type we're just going to make that cost.

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,300
OK.

17
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,280
Now if you call this method anywhere we should actually see notification that message.

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:12,780
OK let's try this with head of what's our consul would call the new team effort and it's like setting

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,220
an object on one of those reports issued by mistake so I would say this is a new message.

20
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,130
It went up and there we go we have this is a new message on the console.

21
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,400
So it's actually picking up that message logging into the console.

22
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,310
Now this is not what we want to do right.

23
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,320
We want to actually meet an event and then we listen to that event from anywhere in application.

24
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,230
Now if you haven't noticed Yes it's so.

25
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:42,460
Actually an event bus which means we can admit events we view the view in stunts and actually also listen

26
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,050
to this event.

27
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,140
I'll show you what I mean.

28
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,880
So notice we have a window view right here.

29
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,040
Let's head over to our console and what we're going to do is see view should be close to new view.

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,680
So we have a new instance of view and what we're going to do is view that on Naughty fight.

31
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:03,610
So again a message and simply console that lock message and for us to know it's actually coming from

32
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:03,850
here.

33
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,080
That's concatenates from custom event boss.

34
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:15,250
And now we got an event listener on of your instance then what we could do is using View Available that

35
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:21,850
we start we could meet that event and that event is going to be notified and we'll pass in the payload

36
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:27,450
which is the message and we're going to see a custom message to events or bus he'd enter.

37
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,270
And we see it's actually lots of console custom message to even boss.

38
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,980
And then it's concatenated string from custom event bus so viewers can naturally artist custom even

39
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,770
box itself.

40
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:45,610
So rather than doing this in the console let's do it in our court so we could say window that events

41
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:54,090
for example is going to be called to new view instance then we can restart our global events.

42
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,810
Listen up.

43
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,130
But on notification checking the notification.

44
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,030
And for now just console that lock litigation.

45
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,880
Received.

46
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,590
OK.

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,890
So we have this event box just like we did in our console and it can actually listen to events.

48
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,870
So now that we've registered this event now we can actually Emmets that events from quantity function.

49
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,690
So we did have that clean window events and would emit notification and we can pass in a payload for

50
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,270
example new message.

51
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:23,830
OK.

52
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,250
So let's have a watch or a console call noti and we have notification received locked right here.

53
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:35,390
OK so why don't we actually wrap this in a custom component so that we can use it in any part of our

54
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,190
application.

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,720
I'm going to create a custom file and this is going to be naughty that view.

56
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,570
And we're going to have templates.

57
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,560
My scripts would export by default an empty object.

58
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,910
Let's just start this with.

59
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,700
Yes.

60
00:03:48,750 --> 00:04:01,160
So the component and would use view naughty as Jim or template then quite an component's naughty that

61
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:01,700
view.

62
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,850
Not what I want to do is it may not see that view.

63
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:14,310
When we compare and is created it I'm going to see a window not events not on much kasian because that's

64
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,110
the event that we are broadcasting.

65
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,290
We're taking the payload.

66
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,990
And for now let's just say console that lock the notification received.

67
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,760
OK.

68
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,600
So in my of the Jest I'm no longer going to listen to this but I'm listening to it in the components.

69
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,440
So when they're called Norty it's going to emit that notification.

70
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,840
And if everything works well we actually see in the console.

71
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,790
There's not one last step we need to make sure we mnze this.

72
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,370
So maybe at the bottom we could mnze view naughty.

73
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,610
And I think that should walk.

74
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,720
Let's try it out how to refresh and would call Nuzzi again.

75
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,070
Yeah.

76
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,730
And we do have the education received.

77
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:57,360
Therefore we are truly listening to that event from our custom components.

78
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,090
Let's head over to our components now and actually try to make this work.

79
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,130
And first of all going to set up a data top in here I'm going to have notification such by default and

80
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:14,370
then right here when I receive that event or I listen to it I'm going to say this the notification equals

81
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,500
payload.

82
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:21,220
Then in my template I can see if we show a cause notification.

83
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:21,760
OK.

84
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,130
So it means if notification is not we are not going to see that template.

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,640
But if it's not no then we're going to see it in our template.

86
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:35,190
We may want to echo the notification message so we might have notification that MSH right up and we

87
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,620
should have a little bit styling for this.

88
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,770
So class of alerts maybe are less successful now.

89
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,910
And what about the positioning.

90
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,210
Where do we want to see it.

91
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,270
Let's just give this a class of Nazi lurch or naughty and what we're going to do is define our custom

92
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,300
sidewalks just what these components would define alert naughty class.

93
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,480
And let's just give this position of fixed.

94
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,170
And if you want it at the bottom right corner or at the bottom sense depending on what you want.

95
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,570
We can give it a right of 20 pleasaunce arm for pigs pixels maybe.

96
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,390
And just to make sure it's floating with give it that index of 1 and that would do it for the styling.

97
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,300
Pretty basic.

98
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,420
So we listen to that event and if the notification is not more then we are going to receive that message.

99
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,000
So that's just rubbish in the tech center.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,370
So how do we trigger a notification event.

101
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,390
We do that by calling or Nuzzi function.

102
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,130
So our function is going to meet that event for us and we taking the notification rather than passing

103
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,810
a new message here we should pass the notification.

104
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:48,640
OK therefore let's head over to what lessons that you are gay and right here we're listening to.

105
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,770
When the lesson is created what we could do is see window the naughty.

106
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,340
I will pass in the notification.

107
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:01,080
We want to notify the users so we're passing the message like great great and this message is going

108
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,240
to be less than create it successfully and get passed in a type of success.

109
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,600
Right.

110
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,920
So we are calling Wiersma thought.

111
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,040
And when we call that mid-thought this method is going to taking the notification that we passed in

112
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,850
and admits that events and no one not see that view component we are listening to that event.

113
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:25,080
And we are going to automatically assign that event to one notification property or kink.

114
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,120
That makes sense.

115
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,610
Let's try this out.

116
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:38,060
Create lesson lesson sayto ID number description and click on a quick lesson button.

117
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,510
And here we have our mistakes lesson created successfully.

118
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:48,170
Bad looks like the message does not go off even after all we've fight saw what we can do is actually

119
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,230
have a time out for this to show.

120
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,240
So what we can do is this the notification equals payload.

121
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,340
And after that we can set a timeout which is going to take in a function and in this function we want

122
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:08,720
to set notification to be quote you know my game and we have to specify the amount of time.

123
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,900
So let's just see 2.5 seconds she's going to do.

124
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:18,110
So set the notification to be called the payload and after 2.5 seconds make showed an indication he

125
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,240
said but no.

126
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:19,740
OK.

127
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,510
So let's try this out one more time.

128
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,990
Quick new lesson new lesson number description.

129
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,440
OK we have that notification and after some time it goes away.

130
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,230
So the positioning is really off but I'm going to take that behind the scenes.

131
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,600
What I want to do right now is truly make this message dynamic.

132
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,040
So rather than having these alerts says I want this class to be dynamic.

133
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:51,020
Therefore what I'm gonna do is bind this class to be called to a computer property or a computer property

134
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,450
is going to is going to get the type of the notification.

135
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:00,750
So we need a computer property right here so we're going to see it and we have the type computer property

136
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,530
and this is simply going to return the class name that we want.

137
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:09,320
For example if we have success then we should have a lot success if we have a danger then we should

138
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,490
have that danger.

139
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,000
Same thing with a warning.

140
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,450
So would return the template string.

141
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:21,190
Words then concatenate that to this litigation type.

142
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,050
OK.

143
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:28,520
So if we ever have an interrogation by industry on the property type and this type is going to simply

144
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,400
return to us class name that matches the notification type.

145
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:32,990
OK.

146
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,330
So what we can do is would help reduce or lessen the view.

147
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,910
And just for demonstration purposes would change these to danger.

148
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,440
OK.

149
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,980
So when the user creates a new lesson make sure that what is I mean that is a danger and we should automatically
