1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,440
It like we said we're going to some kind of procedures.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,680
So I want to tackle this when the use of the speech if he's not locked in he can be asked to log in

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,320
and if he doesn't have an account he can be asked to sign up.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,850
Then if the user is already locked in.

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:20,370
Remember we talked about redirecting him to the CBC wash so that he can just continue but he hasn't

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,840
yet started the series then he can start from the beginning.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,410
OK.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,830
So what are we going to be doing is writing a little test.

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:33,020
So head towards or use that test and this test is simply going to help us to get the next lesson that

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,030
he's supposed to be watching.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,640
OK.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,830
So for example if in a particular series you use us finished use or wants you as one for example and

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,500
we have.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:53,330
And we want to do the naturally that series has four lessons of life as such when the user clicks on

15
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:59,430
to concentrate on the bottle which ones will be used to lesson for another lesson one because it really

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,560
wants to Lesson one.

17
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,110
OK.

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,290
So you couldn't and method that we actually get the lead test which is this one.

19
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,240
And then it's going to get the next lesson in the database which is this one.

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,530
And then we use our two dots one.

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,140
OK.

22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,580
So let's just go with this.

23
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,690
SAS can get next to each lesson.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,840
So we watched by use on talking.

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,510
So what do we need.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,450
Let's just say we need all of this sets up and we need just one sees.

27
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,750
I think in this case.

28
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:35,420
So we have to flush these Then we have Yousaf and then we have a new lesson.

29
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,350
We have another lesson that same series.

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,250
Why don't we create a third lesson in this series.

31
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:48,180
Ok then what are we going to do is we're complete let's move one and two.

32
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:53,900
And I would assert that when we try to visit the watch Seuss rug where we don't get to listen.

33
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:54,560
OK.

34
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:02,290
So we use our complete lesson or commit lesson on complete lesson two.

35
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,260
OK.

36
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,820
So actually this is a unit test.

37
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,740
So let's just test that the method works and that would create a future test to test the redirect.

38
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,220
OK.

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,810
So right now what you want to do is see next to last lesson because you all get.

40
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,850
Next lesson to watch for a series.

41
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,930
So we're passing this idea.

42
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,050
OK.

43
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:32,080
So get next lesson to watch is the method that we want to create and this is called taking the series.

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,580
Such are all of these deals are these the values or the lessons that have been completed and then screen

45
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,160
to get the next lesson or are these I suppose we are watching.

46
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:40,830
OK.

47
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,080
So you just assert equal holes.

48
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,460
And what we can do is compare the ID.

49
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,250
So we want this is less than one lesson to listen to me.

50
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,220
So we once listened to the ID should be called to the next lesson.

51
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,520
And this is something we have to think about because remember we haven't yet told our lessons.

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,200
What are they playing.

53
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,570
So let's go ahead and make sure we do that.

54
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,950
We want to be right the factory settings.

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,180
So in all the lesson actually we just check it out.

56
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,160
What they are doing is we're simply assigning the opposite much 100.

57
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,750
But in this case we want to make sure that we order all these episodes in the correct order.

58
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:35,460
So that's one should be 100 listened to would be to do it.

59
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,000
Lesson we would be very it.

60
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:38,590
OK.

61
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,860
So they're going to play in that or that such that when we complete lesson 1 and 2 the next to be less

62
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,610
than three.

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,350
OK.

64
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,540
So I certainly caused this.

65
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,790
I think I think this is one session we need to warn.

66
00:03:52,830 --> 00:04:06,520
How about creating a fourth lesson on how exactly this bandish would be for the fourth.

67
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:14,280
And then what we can do to solidify sessions is to complete lesson write right here after we've run

68
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,230
the first assertion and then would call our session again.

69
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,820
OK.

70
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,570
So we remember more sessions.

71
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:28,500
You have the more difficult it is for your test oil assertions to be deceptive.

72
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,100
OK.

73
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,340
So we have our next lesson when we assert that it equals days.

74
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:43,510
What we'll do is call this method a game and you see a certain equals less for I will get the idea right.

75
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,130
OK.

76
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,830
So after searching listen to me is the next one to play.

77
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,660
What complete lesson to me.

78
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,350
And then I that lesson for the next one to play.

79
00:04:53,380 --> 00:05:00,140
So I think that says this sets let's go ahead and run it at uni.

80
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,810
So we got this.

81
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,960
OK so we need to create the next lesson.

82
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:13,570
Watch it all the way to my learning the PH B and all that.

83
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:24,680
And the station the suit he's run that again and trying to get hoppity an object as expected.

84
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,310
OK so when do we want do we want to get all the lessons completed for that series and then we want to

85
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,700
just return the last one.

86
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,370
That's what we want to do right.

87
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,020
So we should have a method right here that returns to us all the lessons.

88
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,300
So getting them of completed lessons completed lessons for charades.

89
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:43,760
OK.

90
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:53,920
So all we can do is you can see less than ideal because and this would play Baichu methodology was the

91
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:04,840
last element of an array and we call this good complete lessons for a series of possible series.

92
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,380
OK.

93
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,450
So let's actually check out that method to make sure we are doing the correct thing.

94
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:15,210
We said get our way of computer lesson IDs for Shirish and this is helpful.

95
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,680
We can actually use blocks because right now I'm trying to verify this my fault at all times when I

96
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,160
want you to return and we can check all the.

97
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,540
Returns an array and the palm anti-SUV series of type by Cassy's.

98
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,990
And this is what it does.

99
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,420
Great.

100
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,390
So we can use it.

101
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:30,980
OK.

102
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:39,070
So once we get that idea all we want to do is we turn less and find a pass less than ideal.

103
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:46,600
So we can actually in laying this by not having to create this variable so we can cut this out and pasted

104
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,190
right here.

105
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:55,030
OK so next lesson to watch we squint to get the last element in the Get lesson get completed lessons

106
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,650
for CBS Arri and then he's going to use that to find the lesson.

107
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,260
OK.

108
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:05,750
So let's one that says one more time and you see only eboshi pass by reference.

109
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,270
OK.

110
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:11,660
This is something that should be us we can't call my thoughts in my thoughts in my thoughts.

111
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,300
Too many times and as such.

112
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,060
So let's just stick with the variable.

113
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:23,630
So lesson like the core to this Boston lesson.

114
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,580
OK.

115
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,800
Just so BHB doesn't worry us anymore.

116
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:28,690
OK.

117
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,530
So that's one that and it's still arcane.

118
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,880
So I'm going to do this I'm going to say lesson ID equals.

119
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:43,770
And assume it's ease and rather than getting the right here I'm going to see less of.

120
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,300
That's it.

121
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,630
So it's telling us only the table should be passed by reference that's a catch we think.

122
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,000
OK.

123
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:57,370
So we can actually pass a math thought into this metho so that it takes in available and stuff like

124
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,690
that too much in testing.

125
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,050
So I think it should be fine by now that's one other game.

126
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:08,670
OK so Phil asserting that too much is expected to read.

127
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,870
OK so let's check on that.

128
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,420
Yes.

129
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:16,410
Remember we want the next to lesson that we use I should be watching and not the last lesson these are

130
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,070
watched.

131
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,570
OK.

132
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:24,240
So what we should do is we want to find that lesson we should get the next lesson in the series that

133
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,380
you use or should watch.

134
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,900
OK.

135
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,900
Remember we have get the next lesson.

136
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:35,090
If you had one lesson that Ph.D. we get next lesson in the Sui's in the play list right.

137
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:39,940
So we can call this method up on this lesson.

138
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:40,700
OK.

139
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,490
And the thing that should give us the correct result.

140
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,500
OK so far less than expected type object.

141
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:53,610
Let's check out our tests 1 6 5 set a course lesson for greats who should actually be checking listen

142
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,500
for ID right.

143
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,330
So let's run that one more time.

144
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:58,660
Great.

145
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,810
We have a success with us finally.

146
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:08,620
So all we did was get all the lessons that this is are completed and then we get the idea of the last

147
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,080
one which means that's the leaders that these are completed and then we get that lesson and then we

148
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,980
get the next lesson in the play list.

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,520
OK.

150
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:23,800
So what we can do is actually write a little test to protect our souls because remember we are doing

151
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,950
a lot of assumptions like here in case there is no next lessons watch.

152
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,110
Are we possible into this.

153
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:35,490
My thought it's going to break for example you can break right here because this is Guinta we know and
