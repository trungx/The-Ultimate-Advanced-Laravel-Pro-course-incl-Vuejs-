1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,400
We don't waste any time.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:07,040
We dice tweeting to seen how we can or should prepare a forum so we can create series.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,100
So the demonstrators are going to be able to do this but we can all come out like lieto.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,930
OK so I have my block on suggestion and I'm simply going to pull this one from there and then I'm going

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,630
to formatting.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,840
So block inserts and looks like I'm looking for contact too.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,640
So just copy of this section I want to create a new view so I can literally create my form in that.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,370
So in my view Socius views are mean directory.

9
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,280
I'm going to have a tree and I'm going to create that bleep that Ph.D..

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,640
And this is where I'm actually going to be stopping everything the concerns on us.

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,630
So I create that.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,740
So I mean she was under a tree.

13
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,270
I'm just going to Piscina my phone there.

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,560
Oh and by that we extend the then four section.

15
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,250
It's going to be the content section.

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,070
OK so looks like we also need a header section and I'm looking at this quote for you beach.

17
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,710
The beach would for you to assume and I'm going to copy the header that you have here.

18
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,170
OK.

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,090
So what I want to do is actually register some quotes that are going to be in charge of everything administrates

20
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,140
or everything creating series.

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,780
So while it's up and I'm going to preface this with an injury and I'm going to change this to a good

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,640
method that's going to create the group for us.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,420
Crossing a cruel joke on the kind of carry on definitions.

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,750
So watch resource because I'm going to be Christian reading of the tenens elite in series with us Rojos

25
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,290
to find a resource.

26
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,580
And this is going to be our series and it's going up to a Swiss controller class.

27
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,640
So why don't I just create that class right now.

28
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,670
So Peachtree and sun make control of serious control and are told are able to create and so forth.

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,300
We saw such an awesome.

30
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:48,090
So if I had was my series controller for us to view the routes that it's going to display that page

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,520
let's just return of you.

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,340
So it's in the admin directory that is a tree that creates Marchi and I like when this Mithal matches

33
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,230
this thing.

34
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:57,760
OK.

35
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:06,090
So let's go ahead and see what we get from viscid slash series solution creates Chanoff.

36
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,840
We have that view.

37
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,330
But that winner has a pretty terrific Ani's.
