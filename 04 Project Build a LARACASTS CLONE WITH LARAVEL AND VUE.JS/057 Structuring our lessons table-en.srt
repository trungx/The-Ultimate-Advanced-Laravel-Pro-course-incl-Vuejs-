1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,130
Now let's jump into the car fabrication and that has to do with delayed with the lessons OK.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,270
It's the fun part.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:13,380
So I think I'm going to have a Lessons model so I can make model lesson and I need to my question with

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:13,860
this.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,840
OK let's get that create lessons doable.

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,630
And how do I want this to be.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,720
First of all I want the lesson to be long to a series.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,490
So I'm just going to lean into each other and mops to squeeze ID but I want this to be optional.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,200
So it means I can have stand and lessons if I'm going to meet this knowledge but then I'm also going

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,050
to see chaebol Stream.

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,160
And this is going to be the lesson title and I'm also going to have a lesson description which I'm going

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,890
to make a textfield So description and I should probably actually make sure the series description is

13
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,230
also text are you just going to be baseless then.

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,580
Another thing I want from my lesson is a place number.

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,630
So I'm going to create an airfield which is going to be the least number or we can actually name these

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,800
people that number.

17
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,330
Then finally I want a reference of the video on Vimeo.

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:11,470
So I'm going to see string and the string is going to be the video ID so video ID.

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:17,070
Now we're going to be serving our lessons or videos on Vimeo and then begin to saw a reference to a

20
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,290
video on the lessons table.

21
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:26,070
So for example if the idea on Vimeo was to do something whatever this is the number we can receive here

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,890
and then in our forms and we're going to grab a video with this ID and then present or use us then the

23
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,580
exact number is simply going to help us know how to arrange our suits.

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,240
Then in our lesson Gatsby just so we don't have any annoying ones we're going to make sure that this

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,960
is not protected from us assignment.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,740
Now how do I want this to work.

27
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,870
Remember when we started working on our series controller the Shoma thought Walmsley use are truly Rife's

28
00:01:53,940 --> 00:02:00,720
on this page to show page he's going to have a quick update and delete functionality for lessons for

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,510
that series.

30
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:07,290
And obviously for a better use I experienced this should actually be without refreshing pages or stuff

31
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:07,650
like that.

32
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,300
Right so we're going to use Vue just to make this really awesome.

33
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,100
So before we get to that let's just return of you from here.

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,350
So we turn to you and this is going to be a green or a tree and we have a starter in there an index.

35
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,480
So resources views mean Sui's index that blate Ph be.

36
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,570
OK so if we check out a directory structure Dessa index that late I'm just going to duplicate what they

37
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:39,780
have to create because I want almost the same header and the content is very similar but I'm just going

38
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,030
to pull out a form.

39
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,410
Yeah we should probably send the suicide data off from our controller.

40
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,220
So why don't we just pass in with series and pass in the C right here.

41
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,230
OK so now we're passing the series.

42
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,970
Therefore we can use a series title right here.

43
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:02,310
And this is going to be the page where we customize your series lessons and it's going to be a lot of

44
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,390
view just going on in here.

45
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,700
OK.

46
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,330
So that's what we see that beach.

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,980
So I mean seriously brush this course then do our experts here then we have the cost title then Carson

48
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,970
you serious lessons.

49
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,970
OK so we're going to actually switch to front and walk in the very next video and start customizing

50
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,640
our lessons right here.
