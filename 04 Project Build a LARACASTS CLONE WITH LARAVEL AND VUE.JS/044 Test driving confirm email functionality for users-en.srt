1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,480
Oh OK so I'll do the ones from the US.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,530
We want to use that on this march on.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,800
And we should actually take us to our results on our web application.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,750
That's going to pick up the token.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,030
So it might actually be a POST or GET request but probably get to work with.

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,650
So we're going to pass the token as a promise.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,800
You know I get requests and then I pick it up with an obligation find to use that to come and make sure

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,070
we can from the use if we don't find and use then we're going to handle the kids.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,160
So why don't we do this with some tests.

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,180
So let's just generate a new test.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,280
So here are some quick tests confirm e-mail tests.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,860
So let's head to whatsoe'er confound e-mail test and try another function on the superbly function sayst

13
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,290
a Yusof can confirm email.

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,290
Ok so how are we going to be doing this.

15
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:49,670
OK.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:57,550
So how are we going to be good and then send that email of sending the e-mail whatever walks.

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:05,100
And then we'll make a get request to the confirm and then assert that they use all these confirm.

18
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,580
So let's go ahead and do that.

19
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,460
Create a use always Simplicio use or use for actually for own use or class Craigavon.

20
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:19,940
OK so right here let's just use but guess use of how we use or the next thing is to send that e-mail.

21
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,260
I don't think this is actually necessary in this test case.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,870
So we just go ahead and make that Kate and Chris.

23
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,450
So we're going to see this gets.

24
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,850
And how do we want to you know we're just going to see registar confirm and remember like we agreed

25
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,200
we're going to be passing in the can into the get requests I support.

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,930
So what I'd like to do centrally use a better US and such right here so double Portes could simply on

27
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,090
sites where it's open he calls and hustling use are confirmed to come right here also.

28
00:01:52,210 --> 00:02:00,650
So suspensory so rich you start confirm then pass in the can and for the response let's just assert

29
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:06,040
redirects and in this case we're going to be posting in the beach to make sure that you use such a newbie.

30
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,110
That's the home page.

31
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,950
We make that request so that essentially that makes it.

32
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,680
And we also have said that in USALS confirmed this a search through news or confront create a use or

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,960
make a request that in point person in the can.

34
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,650
And then I said that you use I should be directed to this point.

35
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,620
And then I said true that the user is confirmed.

36
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,310
So let's go ahead and do this.

37
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:34,610
I'm going to use Refresh database and I'm going to run this specific test only.

38
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,790
Ok that's funny.

39
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,280
OK.

40
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,240
So I was promised us I would fall for it's not that we don't make stuff to school.

41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,390
Now if you want to have more information about it section those when you can actually disable exception

42
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,000
handling.

43
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,980
But now we know what's a full force which is squarehead Aquilius endpoint.

44
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,660
Right.

45
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:57,490
So you know what that BHB we want to create a routes gets which is a registar session for him.

46
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,410
And let's just say it maps to confirm.

47
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,350
Email construal Arts Index Mitha one on to gain share info.

48
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,250
We have a 500 but let's just go ahead and disable exception handling.

49
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,480
So this without exception mean that's funda.

50
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,690
Now we have more help for everyone that sees this control of us and they exists.

51
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,380
PH We Irish Sun Macon's long confirmed email.

52
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,780
Well now that that's created let's run the test again.

53
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,040
SUGI Sison all because we don't have the index misthought.

54
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,860
So let's just have to watch and confirm.

55
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,890
IMO controller and the next marathon run that one more time and we have 200.

56
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,440
It's not a direct at school because this is a skill we need to do because we have nothing here active.

57
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,880
So what do we want to do we need to get the token from the request to come and then we need to find

58
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,950
a use on where these two can lead.

59
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:00,440
So use on where I'm confused is equal to the token that we just got then.

60
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:07,200
Let's just check if we have a user then see user or confirm which is a helpful methadose and begin to

61
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,040
help us confirm the news.

62
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,260
And then we turn directs to the homepage.

63
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,070
OK.

64
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,620
So can they use a way that confirms or can exist or can that we get from the request.

65
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,140
And then we turn these up to the home page.

66
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,120
OK let's try out another area.

67
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,410
Colchicine you find coming from that's expected.

68
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,700
So it generally means know use.

69
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:38,220
So you know use all the Ph.D. there's just create that confirm with a public function for one audience

70
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,070
and we still have an interesting course on the Feynman fought on the ground you know confirm and that

71
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,720
should be my fault because these are which Strawson Kraybill that instance right.

72
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,490
So let's just get the first use of which is to the result from the query one that says we have green

73
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,280
that's so unexpected.

74
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,900
Let's DeBoer and see what we have.

75
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,560
First of all you know comes from email.

76
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,000
We are such an a redirects that's died on the use of right to see what it gets.

77
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,660
And the thing is we're actually essentially.

78
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:18,840
The thing is actually such actually on reaching the conference could say we forgot or did not.

79
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:28,190
So our factory needs to generate a confirmed token for the news stream pattern for us and less for not

80
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,770
just now and see what we get.

81
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,190
Our key expected LR feel a sense that false is true.

82
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,780
Because obviously right here on he's returning false because we are confirming the news.

83
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,250
And we are trained.

84
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:40,940
True.

85
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,780
So you know that we all we need to do is confirm the news right here.

86
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,810
So these confirm tokin equals.

87
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,310
And we just need to save those changes.

88
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:53,780
That's it.

89
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:54,410
OK.

90
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,310
So we pull out to confirm so can such an all.

91
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,670
And then we see if the user objects and hopefully notwork says should pass.

92
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,440
So let's run that test one more time and we still have a feel and I'm going to show you why we have

93
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,620
Freedia because when we get the use I'll just wait here even after we updated level does not refresh

94
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,620
its copy for the test rate so it's not like it's cost.

95
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:22,440
So what we're going to do is use law was Freshmeat thought to get a fresh copy from the database because

96
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,080
we the check and then would see what we get.

97
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,150
Let's run again.

98
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,510
And yeah we have green.

99
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,060
Okay.

100
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,650
So let's go through the system again to see what we have we have this new test can confirm email and

101
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:41,440
what this is doing such and making sure that the Zicam confirms even now we quit use up and after doing

102
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,960
that we make sure that we use are actually actually generates confronted for that.

103
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,160
So then we make a good question that points passing in the token to that Mithal.

104
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,740
Right.

105
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,190
As I said maybe that's a decent beach meaning that was successful.

106
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,640
And then also as such would not be Yousaf is confirmed.

107
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,880
And if we check over so our use of PH We we have that is confronted with all the checks from toucans

108
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,190
and all I know confirm mid-thought that actually sets that second to none.

109
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,180
Then we have all confirmed the smoke.

110
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:21,660
We simply gets the token finds a use of the token and then come from news use and we directly use the

111
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,380
home page.

112
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:27,770
So we could actually in line the so we don't create useless we will and it's going to work.

113
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,110
So let's want access one more time and that's good.

114
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,680
We're good to go.
