1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,980
Two very important Methos we're going to need a cigarette next lesson and get previous lesson.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,640
So we should have this Methos on one lesson class and issue be really useful when we want to may be

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,850
automatically redirect the user to the next lesson he wants to watch.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,400
All we want to display the next and previous buttons on the use on the washing page.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,700
Ok maybe another play or something like that.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,200
OK.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,380
So let's go ahead and take off.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,410
This would actually use a test to test drive this.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:37,780
So I'm going to create a new test BHP areason make test and this would be the lesson I asked and specify

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,180
that it's unit.

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:39,920
OK.

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:46,660
So headbutts are lessons asked and who are first asked this would be a public function.

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:53,110
So I asked can get next and previous lessons from a lesson.

14
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,150
OK.

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,060
So how do we organize this.

16
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:08,370
Given that we have a series of lessons called Get next lesson and get previous lesson my thoughts and

17
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,080
then withdrawn some assertions.

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,120
So when we are creating these serious lessons we are going to organize them in a particular we call

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,090
these my thoughts on one day sessions.

20
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,590
OK.

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,080
So let's dive into this.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:29,200
First I'm just going to use but cost series and that costs less than then here although although is

23
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,760
Azzi lesson or I'll just head over to my sisters attorney and then I'm just going to copy this.

24
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,190
OK.

25
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,650
Because this is exactly what we need.

26
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,350
Then back to my lessons.

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:49,770
Asked I'll just paste this in so I'm resizing the lesson has a piece about 200 lessons to a piece of

28
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,160
100 unpleasantry has the opposite number of 200.

29
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,030
Therefore actually less one less than two is the first to play.

30
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,260
Then there's this one place and then this one please.

31
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,480
That's how it's supposed to be.

32
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,050
OK.

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,410
So what we'll do is we'll call next lesson math art.

34
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,820
So next lesson because the lesson get next lesson.

35
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,660
OK.

36
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,780
So so we're calling get next lesson on this one.

37
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,330
And this is episode 200.

38
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,950
Therefore the next lesson should be episode 200.

39
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,580
Right here.

40
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,140
OK.

41
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:32,090
So let's on an assertion this cert equals next lesson ID.

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,510
And this is less than three ID.

43
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,600
Right.

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:43,330
Then we can say this a cert equals get previous lesson and we'll get the ID.

45
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,700
So looks like we don't even need this table right here.

46
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,740
I'll just pull it out.

47
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,340
OK.

48
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,420
So I was getting next lesson ID from us and.

49
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,730
And if we are calling less than three which is this one and we are getting the previous lesson that

50
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,850
it should be this right.

51
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,310
Right.

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,460
So he assert that the ID cause lesson ID.

53
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,140
OK.

54
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:11,600
So let's also call the lesson to show our set equals lesson to get the next lesson.

55
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,660
All righty.

56
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,120
So this is lesson in school.

57
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,940
Therefore if we get the next lesson it should be this one.

58
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,760
Right.

59
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,950
So if you get the next lesson and I said that because that's an idea.

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,040
And then we should also get assert equals lessons soon.

61
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:36,630
So what if so what if we get the previous lesson even though we know this one is actually the first

62
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,590
lesson.

63
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,200
Right.

64
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,140
It means we are expecting that lesson 2 which is the first.

65
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,300
If we get previous lesson we should expect more.

66
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,540
They're going to change this to suddenly all that get previous lesson.

67
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,680
We don't know.

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,180
And it's very important that you actually return.

69
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,470
No I'm not.

70
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,060
OK.

71
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,980
Because if your implementation breaks your code then it's really dangerous.

72
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:06,720
So if it we don't know what we can do in our view is check if this is not know then displayed a previous

73
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,480
lesson or if it's not know then play the next quarter or something like that.

74
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:11,950
OK.

75
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:18,510
So if your implementation actually breaks if it's it doesn't find a previous lesson or next lesson then

76
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,300
it's not a really cool implementation because you need to start handling errors and all that.

77
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,870
OK.

78
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:33,990
So let's also ask that when we get the last lesson we just listen to me and we try to get next lesson.

79
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,010
It also gives us all.

80
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,540
OK.

81
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,300
So I think we've won a bunch of assertions right here.

82
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,470
And I think it's really going to guide us in making this methodic pass our case.

83
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:52,460
So that's one hit PH BE field by this test grade course on the find method get the next lesson.

84
00:04:52,590 --> 00:05:01,640
So we head over to our lesson of BHB and create that methodic redneck's lessons it again trying to get

85
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,830
property of object.

86
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,350
Why.

87
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:10,660
Because this fosters It's getting good next lesson which returns at the moment.

88
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,360
And we're trying to get the ID.

89
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:12,850
OK.

90
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,350
So let's just work on this method to make sure that it passes.

91
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,120
First we know the services that this lesson belongs to.

92
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:19,770
OK.

93
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:28,850
So what we can do is see this series and we'll get all the lessons for this series such that we know

94
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:34,850
that we have reduced all our database records to the lessons that concern this particular series.

95
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,700
And then we would search.

96
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,950
This is where the episode number is greater than this episode.

97
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:52,100
And once we get on the lessons where the episode number is greater than this episode number we are going

98
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,640
to order the results.

99
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,790
So order by episodes in ascending order.

100
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,970
And finally we get the first results.

101
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:03,780
OK.

102
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:10,620
So get the series so that you get all the lessons that are only in this series and then you search where

103
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,350
the opposite number is greater than this one.

104
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,680
And if it's greater than you or that in ascending order such that the next will be at the very top and

105
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,870
then you get the first.

106
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,710
OK so let's run this.

107
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,090
And we still get this train to get property of no object error.

108
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,810
Ok let's try to do both together.

109
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:36,200
We have this Sui's lessons and this is supposed to return to us a collection of all the lessons that

110
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,520
belong to the series that this lesson belongs to which is to me in this case.

111
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,230
Yeah.

112
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,270
And then we get where EPS number is greater than this opposite number.

113
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,600
And in this case it should return only this one because that's the only one that passes that condition

114
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,580
right.

115
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,870
And then we should order in ascending order just in case we have more than one.

116
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,690
And then he should return to us the first result.

117
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,280
OK.

118
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,040
It's supposed to succeed but for some reason it's not.

119
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,120
So I'll show you how I did back in these cases.

120
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,460
So right here I know it's written in knol.

121
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:19,880
Then what I'm going to do is for every single step of this I'm going to try to do Bach at a certain

122
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,370
point.

123
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:20,980
OK.

124
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:29,120
So for example this series of lessons I'm going to just died on the results of that operation to make

125
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
sure that it gives me what I expect.

126
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:31,720
OK.

127
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,930
So rather than calling these I'm just going to call the property.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,540
So I get on and if I run that gives me an array of one element rather than three that we created.

129
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:51,800
And if we check how out the series ID it's giving us a series of 11 and I think I know why this is because

130
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:59,090
every time we run a test it's going to create a new series create new lessons because we are not refreshing

131
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,570
our database.

132
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,930
Ok found it.

133
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,790
So we need to refresh our database so that we have fresh data every time we run our test.

134
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,230
OK.

135
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,920
So this died don't break your run that fast one more time.

136
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:20,390
And we have caught on to find mid-thought get previous lesson great which means our next lesson was

137
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,410
suspected.

138
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,110
OK.

139
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,230
So let's quit this.

140
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,590
Get previous lesson mid-thought which is going to be a public function.

141
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,490
Get to this lesson and what do we do.

142
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,570
Let's return this series of lessons.

143
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:40,880
And remember we are skipping to only the lessons for this series because we can do something like solve

144
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,760
where but this is going to give us all lessons records in the database and then we can be comparing

145
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,370
the episode numbers because they're going to get mixed up.

146
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:55,070
Remember the episode numbers can be duplicated and they also belong to different service so we get only

147
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:01,660
for this service and we use the brackets right here because we need a KBO that in a sense.

148
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:09,590
And I'm not so sure if we need it because remember on collection's we have when methodes we have way

149
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:16,220
in my thoughts and in this case if we use this we actually have an instance of illuminate database eloquent

150
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,810
collection.

151
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,180
Well I'm going to leave that to you to find out.

152
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:27,020
But I'm just going to stick to the basics and then I'm going to call my where I thought the episode

153
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:34,480
number is less than this episode number and this is going to give us a list of all the lessons opposite

154
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,590
numbers are less than the one that we are check in.

155
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:44,350
And then and then we can order by episode number because nobody to for the other by the IDs so what

156
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:50,410
get out of my episodes and will put that in our star and we'll get the last.

157
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,140
OK.

158
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,210
So I'm not sure about that but let's walk through it together.

159
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:02,310
If we haven't gone for three five six and I walk in with idea of five.

160
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:08,550
Therefore when we run this query is going to give us we're going to be in the order in ascending order

161
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,850
we're going to have one and three.

162
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,680
And the previous is supposed to be three.

163
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,000
So I think getting the last is the reasonable choice.

164
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,810
OK.

165
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,580
So let's run this test is going to tell us if we are right or not.

166
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,230
OK.

167
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,120
It's called the find method on the query before the last.

168
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,200
OK.

169
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,190
So we're working with the Kraybill the here and not our collection.

170
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:37,950
Therefore we can call the last but what we can do is all the days in descending order and still call

171
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,830
our first method.

172
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,830
OK.

173
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,220
So let's run that says one more time.

174
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,100
And great.

175
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,200
We're going so we are successfully getting the next and previous lessons.

176
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,870
Now how are we going to use this.

177
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:57,320
And I watched that lead the Ph.D. We can now comfortably have next to button on the previous button

178
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,340
on the play so that the user can watch the next lesson or can also go back to the previous lesson.

179
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,070
We'll talk about that more in the next lesson.
