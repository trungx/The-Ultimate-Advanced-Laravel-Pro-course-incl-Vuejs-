1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,740
OK access to the queen.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:08,190
Now what do we want to do is test a little bit more my thoughts that we're going to be using for our

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,070
learning process and then we're going to go to the next step.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,870
Now the first thought I want to test is a thought that I'm going to start that series and this method

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:23,110
is going to help us know if you actually clicked on that starts with Martin and is actually watching

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:23,700
the series.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,400
OK.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,480
So this is going to be a unique test like this.

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:34,510
So you know I use that as we're going to create a new test so public function science can know if a

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,150
user has started a series.

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:37,900
OK.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,010
So how do we want this test to work.

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:48,160
First we need a user right and then we need maybe to see race and then they use our watches or completes

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,330
a lesson in the first series.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,150
And he does know which one in the second series.

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:05,700
Ok then we asserts that we turn into four has started a series for the first series and then has set

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,690
that series for the second series does not return true it returns false.

18
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,790
OK so let's go ahead and do it you'll understand more.

19
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,450
So first of all since we had to live with Reddy's we're going to flush with this.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,320
So flush Reddy's will get to use our Krikalev son also create some from them lessons just like we're

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,620
doing here.

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,700
And I think we're going to need all of this.

23
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:35,480
So I'm going to copy that come right here to my instep and pasted it so use up and then we have a lesson

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,590
and we have two one on lessons right here.

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,530
So what I'm going to do is the son and this and two should belong to one series.

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,290
So two series one just like it is now and then I'm going to create lesson to see which should belong

27
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,120
to and not the series.

28
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,780
Therefore I'm going to remove this customizing right here.

29
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,220
So we have two lessons that belong to series one.

30
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,510
And then we have one lesson that belongs to Sui's 2 which is going to automatically be created by this

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,060
tree.

32
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,730
OK.

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,990
Now we want to complete a lesson in serious one.

34
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:16,980
So I would say use our complete lesson and let's say he completes Lesson 2 for example.

35
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,660
Ok then we can run our sessions.

36
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,820
We're going to see this.

37
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:31,520
I search through that use hostile and will pass in series one as a human right here.

38
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:31,900
OK.

39
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,170
So we get the lesson in this lesson right here and we'll get it serious.

40
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,560
OK.

41
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:46,850
Which is the same as Lesson two serious dent ones are so false that you are has starts at series for

42
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,530
less than three.

43
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,810
OK so over a haystack that she was mid-thought when we pass in series one into this methodic should

44
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:59,750
return true because we actually completed a lesson in that series meaning we started learning that series

45
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,300
and should return false because we have not completed and service for less than 3 Savi so we should

46
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,750
be checking for less than three right here.

47
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,290
OK.

48
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:15,810
Because we haven't completed any series in the series to which is from this series because this is really

49
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,860
going to generate a new series.

50
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,420
Then be some false but then this would be true because we have seen this one right here and we completed

51
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,030
our lesson and see which one.

52
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,720
OK.

53
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,190
So let's run this test.

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:34,410
The unit FUTA should this test great.

55
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,410
So we don't have that mid-thought he started serious.

56
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,930
Now we're just head of what are we learning.

57
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,270
PH be right on the bottom.

58
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,490
We can quit that method.

59
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,010
OK.

60
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:51,750
So this mathematics in a serious class one that again so feel asserting that no is true but they should

61
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,960
actually return a boolean right.

62
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,240
So what we're going to do is we're going to get the specific key for that use on that series.

63
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:00,880
Okay.

64
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,820
And then we can check if the number of elements in that army is greater than zero.

65
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,580
If it's greater than zero it means to use naturally completer one lesson in that series.

66
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,720
But then if it's zero it means the use or not complete anything.

67
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,130
Right.

68
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:23,880
So we have a good number of computer lessons for seeress so we can return this get number of completed

69
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,740
the lessons for a series we'll pass in the series right here.

70
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,050
So we have now a number which is the number of lessons that the user has completed for this particular

71
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,620
series.

72
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,460
Then we can compare to zero.

73
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,100
And if it's greater than zero it means the user has completed at least one of the lessons in this series

74
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,430
which means the user has started the series.

75
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:49,710
But then if it's not greater than zero zero it means the user has not yet started this series.

76
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,350
And our video store does not have any record of it.

77
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,870
OK.

78
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,520
So let's run our test one more time great.

79
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,080
And we have a successful test.

80
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,610
OK.

81
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:08,110
So we can now use that series in our views wherever we want to check if the user has started series.

82
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,300
So for example on the land each way for a series we can check has the user started the series or started

83
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,240
the series then rather than just plain starts reset button display a continuous series.

84
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,290
MARTIN OK.

85
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,940
So thank you so much for watching.

86
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,160
Let's continue with some fun thoughts in the next lesson.
