1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,010
You guys let's actually get the ID from our of these.

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:10,250
So I'm going to have to watch you play and I'm going to get the idea of a you video for example.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,220
This one right here.

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:11,810
OK.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,350
So copy that ID and then I'm going to head back to our series.

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,050
This and this series as it does the job.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:26,350
And I'm going to pasting that idea to see if and automatically we have some of the successfully awesome.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,980
So now when I visit my home and I visit this series I can continue on.

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,210
And in and he takes me to the speech imbeds this video.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,620
But now I want to pass in the Real I.D. from the server from the dates of these.

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,180
OK.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,580
So what are we going to do.

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,160
We cannot accept props on the first and maybe only quote We are going to receive the lesson.

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,940
And then you may want to leave the pitch.

15
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,200
We just need to pass lesson because the lesson that we received.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,480
So I mean these supplements you're going to cost the student Jason Parsons to the video player.

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,070
OK.

18
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:11,440
So let's just refresh these and check out if we have that data that's good or viewed to our view player.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,160
And there we go.

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,770
We actually have the juice and structure of that particular lesson.

21
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,360
OK.

22
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:23,410
So what do you want to do is in our play let's just call the default and then I will need to change

23
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,280
these two defaults.

24
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,070
Lesson.

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:26,830
OK.

26
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:31,940
So now that we have default lesson in our props we are going to have a D.

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,720
So we're just going to return an object and we're going to have the lesson property right here.

28
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,040
And this is simply going to be Jason and postes.

29
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,960
This is the default lesson.

30
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,470
OK so keep refresh just to check that out check of the area.

31
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,860
And there we go.

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,880
We have props and then we have this lesson object right.

33
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,540
OK.

34
00:01:53,590 --> 00:02:03,190
So we have the video I.D. right now in our template we can just see the lesson then we're going to buying

35
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:10,100
these dates of the new I.D. to lessen the Jew I.D..

36
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:10,890
OK.

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,120
So let's check this song fresh.

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,450
Check out our play now.

39
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,100
We have that object but looks like we don't have the play.

40
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,820
Let's check other council and it looks like we didn't load the video right.

41
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,100
So we go back to the video again.

42
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:26,730
Yeah.

43
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,220
The video has some right permissions so this is what I was talking about.

44
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,900
So the obvious Jihad set has said domain restrictions.

45
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:39,160
So let's just fetch for a free video that we cannot truly embed.

46
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,620
And if we check out this one yeah we can actually embed this with you.

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,180
Right.

48
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,090
So let's copy that ID one more time.

49
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,240
Head over to all series this the page for this.

50
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:58,820
But is serious at that pace that we join the safe lesson then the virtual home

51
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,840
visit this serious continual learning and there we go.

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,710
We have this exact video.

53
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,240
OK.

54
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,530
So this video right here that we embed that automatically we have the video of the ball on our war.

55
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,320
OK.

56
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,920
So we are actually actually displaying the video from the database.

57
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,180
That's great progress.

58
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,760
In the very next lesson.
