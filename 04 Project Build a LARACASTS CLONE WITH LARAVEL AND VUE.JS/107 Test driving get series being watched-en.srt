1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,660
OK guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,480
Iraq's a little bit of walk on they use us so we can actually see something.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,730
The concerns they use are OK.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,040
So I just created a little template right here that we're going to be using because we're going to come

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,100
to the money parts.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,730
We're going to need maybe a week for the use of the card and stuff like that.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,460
So I decided to create you know our very top system right here.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,000
OK.

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,600
So you cannot really just copy this on the template.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,440
It's really easy.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:28,980
OK.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,070
So we can also be editing the users for free and stuff like that.

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,300
But first I want us to talk with this.

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,390
We can get the lessons completed for the user and we can get the series brainwashed.

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:39,860
OK.

16
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,470
So remember this is just a now that I'm just using.

17
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:50,180
So what we can do is actually drive out the number of lessons completed and see just been washed test.

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,500
So we can actually have those methods then we're just going to use them in our view.

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,100
OK.

20
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:01,110
So let's go ahead to our user test and we're going to create a test to make sure that we can get the

21
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,630
number of lessons completed or actually we should start with the series being watched.

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,400
OK.

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:12,660
So we're going to see test all series being watched by years.

24
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,730
OK.

25
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,640
So what we want is we want to create a user.

26
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,460
We want to create some lessons for CBS.

27
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,150
OK.

28
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:28,930
So let's say we need to flush out the tables because we will create a user create a lesson or two.

29
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,860
I mean just be studying right now.

30
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,540
So we have one series right.

31
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,130
So why don't we create a second series and this series is going to be having less than three.

32
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,960
And we also have less than four for this series.

33
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:50,970
So therefore four lessons lesson four to belong to see which two we just need to specify series ID right

34
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,560
here that you two.

35
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,140
OK.

36
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,530
So what we have now is two lessons belonging to series one and two lessons belong to Suvi to switch

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,060
to.

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,610
OK.

39
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:08,870
So that's our instep now for action would complete some lessons in series 1 and 2.

40
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,470
OK.

41
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:15,060
Remember this is how we used to know if the user has actually started the series if he has completed

42
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,380
at least one of the lessons in that series.

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,390
Then once we complete those lessons with one of my assertions we'll call our math to get the series

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,190
that this user is watching and then would assert that Tsui Swan is a man.

45
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,590
And also I said that's Zeus too is our mom.

46
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,160
OK.

47
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,070
So what we can do is let's just create another series for our own security.

48
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,510
So we're going to have five and six.

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,920
So five and six belong to series ID.

50
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,650
OK.

51
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,280
So we have to see which right now and then we're also going to assert at the end that series 3 is not

52
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,020
among the least of series that this user is watching.

53
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,760
OK now let's go ahead and complete lesson on Anderson twe.

54
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:14,070
So we use our complete lesson will pass in lesson and then use our complete lesson on past in Lesson

55
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,620
three.

56
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,450
OK so we've completed this for see.

57
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:24,370
We've committed this forces of Saussy wish to therefore with no completive and UFOs streaming into issues

58
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,470
into which one and two bodies are watching.

59
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,570
We therefore the next thing we need to do is get the satellite series.

60
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:31,990
OK.

61
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,970
So start that series or the series that this user is watching.

62
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,990
So we'll would say get this by calling use our series being watched method.

63
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,540
OK.

64
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,760
So this is the method that we call to get all the services that are being watched by these user then

65
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,600
we need to decide what type of detail this method should be returning to us.

66
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,230
OK.

67
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:01,160
So why don't we receive our current election of series and they think this is going to actually be helpful.

68
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:06,190
So now we need to run our sessions knowing that we want our collection of series.

69
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:14,130
So we're going to first of all see a surge in stands of eliminate support collection class and pass

70
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:20,940
in stuff that's serious and then the next assertion is to make sure that that collection is actually

71
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,130
a collection of series.

72
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:30,390
So I would call certain stands off but this time we'll be checking that it's an instance of a broadcast

73
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:37,610
series class and we'll get any random element from that collection.

74
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,050
And finally just like we did in the other test I want to get the ideas singlehandedly from this.

75
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:55,560
So I've discussed the ideas of such a series because you started a series Pulok only the ideas and then

76
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,380
I would just see all so it returns to me and I see the idea of all of this stuff that's serious.

77
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,140
OK then I'll say this search.

78
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,080
Who are we.

79
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,890
And we need to pass in the middle.

80
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:15,830
So I would say lesson which is lesson one and we'll get the series and we'll get the ID and we'll passing

81
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,470
the haystack which is IDs of stuff that's serious.

82
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,300
OK.

83
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,820
So we also have to do exactly the same thing for lesson here because this is lesson to be are complete

84
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,750
an age which means lesson series to also should be inside this ID.

85
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,490
So Lesson 3 series I should be here.

86
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:40,160
And then we're going to do the same thing for less than four but it's going to be false.

87
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,900
So actually for less than five or six anyone.

88
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,420
OK.

89
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:49,050
So I said force that lesson six ideas inside this series.

90
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,600
OK so this is a really long test.

91
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,550
So let's go ahead and go through it before we start one in our test.

92
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,140
First we want to get all the series being watched by this user.

93
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,040
So we are ready.

94
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,570
The trouble is then we get the use of a new user.

95
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,430
We create some serious.

96
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,900
So right here we've created one and we've added two lessons that's used here.

97
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:16,310
We've created two and we've added two lessons that we use and we've also created a third series and

98
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,720
we've added two lessons to that use.

99
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:25,960
Now we've made the use of stop watching series one by completing one lesson series one.

100
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,070
And we've also made the use of a stopwatch in Series 2 by completing one lesson in Series 2 right here.

101
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:39,140
OK then we get all the stuff that's serious series my watch Matt gets in this methode series being watched

102
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,370
and then we assert that what is returned to us is a collection.

103
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,360
And what is returned inside that collection our suits.

104
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:55,130
And then we get all the ideas from this collection and then we assert that the idea of see which one

105
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,440
is actually that very idea of Zeus is a story that I read but I also say it is not.

106
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,750
OK so let's go ahead and run this test to see what we get.

107
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,330
You know feuds are to this test.

108
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,390
OK so caught on the find mid-thought C-rist being watched so would Healthwatch are learning that.

109
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,030
Ph be.

110
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,900
And what creates that method is being watched.

111
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,900
OK so let's run that again.

112
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,190
And now Phil as such is an instance of eliminate support collection.

113
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,490
OK so this is all we have to talk about how we want this to work.

114
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,990
OK so first of all remember this is all we are saving our records in the database.

115
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,400
OK.

116
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:43,510
So we use our user id series and then Series ID.

117
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,180
OK.

118
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,290
And this is all we have in our Rennie's database.

119
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:54,410
What we can do is to get all the keys for a particular use or for any series then we can pass in a white

120
00:07:54,410 --> 00:08:01,450
card to this database and then find any key that ends with this and that has the user's ID.

121
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,810
I'm going to show you what I mean.

122
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:11,360
Remember for this use or if you want to get maybe use of one serious one it means we are getting all

123
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,470
the completed lessons for use on one and see which one the same thing if they use those watching series

124
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:17,930
too.

125
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:25,790
OK so same thing if the user was watching so its true were going to have a one series too.

126
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:31,350
And if the user was watching series we were going to have a one and we're going to have Series 3.

127
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:31,910
OK.

128
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,710
So what he says is this is the only thing that changes the number right here.

129
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,850
So we can start the database to give us all the keys which half use a woman and which are serious and

130
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,680
they will put a wild right here to get all of these records.

131
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:53,750
OK so if we have all of these records in our database then we passed in Diski what is going to happen

132
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,650
is we are going to have all of these sent back to us.

133
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,990
Therefore when we receive all of this we know the user is watching we want to choose a history and we

134
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,350
can not extract this idea to get the series on the database and send in a collection.

135
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,200
OK so let's get to it.

136
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:18,470
We'll get the keys so key is because Reddy's and release has a key Smith thought and we can pass in

137
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,970
a word Katsu.

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,580
This is when you search in its store to see if we have keys that match this pattern.

139
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:35,360
So what we'll do is we'll call use our and then we'll call this right and then call on series and Kaalam

140
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,620
and then we'll pass in an asterix to show a white cut.

141
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,970
So we have gone through a rewrite here.

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,640
It's going to be returned to us.

143
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:47,950
OK then we can now extract or find a series on the database with this case.

144
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,340
So one is going to be returned to us is going to be an array of maybe use or once every few years or

145
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,240
once we see one.

146
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:54,700
OK.

147
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,210
Depending on the number of lessons or series that the user is watching.

148
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:04,020
Then when we have these this we can use a For Each loop to look to each and every one of these kids

149
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,580
because remember we have an hour we birds we need to reach our collection.

150
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,710
So for each.

151
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:18,890
And then I'll just call and for each right here and I'll say kids ask me and we be doing is right here

152
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:26,030
I'm just going to show you what would do would get serious ID by Colleen explode which is a natural

153
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,580
function.

154
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,110
I'm going to explain what it does.

155
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:34,330
I would say that the limiter is a Kahlon and would pass in key right there.

156
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,030
OK.

157
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,160
So if you read up see if you read out what I expect from those it returns an array of strings each of

158
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,870
which is a substring of string formed by splitting it into boundaries formed by the string delimiter.

159
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,450
OK.

160
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:56,520
So this is what it's going to do if we have use of one colon one colon series called twe then our explode

161
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,020
function is going to give us an array as such.

162
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:06,910
So you are then one then a series and then three.

163
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,040
OK.

164
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,130
So it's going to take this delimiter that we passed in.

165
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,470
So this column right here and it's going to use it to break the string into an array.

166
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,110
OK.

167
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:22,790
So for example if we had a string it can be maybe a string with cos if you want to break each and every

168
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,210
one of these parts into an array you just explode and use the comma.

169
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,460
OK so now we have an array of such.

170
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,990
And for us to get this element we can just get it right here.

171
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:42,150
So we would say get the element read the the key of tweak the index of tweak OK because it is 0 1 2

172
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:42,700
3.

173
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,530
So we can get the element of index of 3 which is the series ID.

174
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:51,900
Ok then now that we have that series ID we can actually store 8 in an array.

175
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,430
So let me just create a series IDs are we right here.

176
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,310
Okay.

177
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:04,440
And then after we have these we can just see how we push which is a pitch we thought and we can push

178
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,630
in to the series.

179
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,530
Ideas are.

180
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,750
And the value we're pushing is Series ID.

181
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,010
Once we have the ID of the series we'll push it into this avi and then remember we want our mid-thought

182
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,020
to get a collection and returns us.

183
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,600
OK.

184
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:31,000
So what we're going to do is get serious Kollection is going to be cost you collects series IDs.

185
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,050
OK so now we have a collection of IDs.

186
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:41,850
Then we'll just map over that collection pass in a close up and right here we're going to have access

187
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,840
to the ID.

188
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,440
OK.

189
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,140
So then we're going to return series find ID.

190
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,200
OK.

191
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,100
So this is our collection.

192
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,290
We simply get a collection.

193
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:58,900
My Christian collects on the series ID's Ari and then we can map to that collection.

194
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,040
And then for each of the elements in that collection we are simply going to find the series with that

195
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,770
ID and then return it.

196
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,440
OK.

197
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:14,010
So for us to actually USE the reason we have to report it at the top so use broadcast series and then

198
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:18,300
right down at the bottom we can actually return this.

199
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:18,890
OK.

200
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,440
So we turned the collection once we finished mapping over it.

201
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,370
OK so that is a lot.

202
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,290
OK we've done a lot on this method.

203
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,300
We're going to go for it.

204
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,130
But now let's just focus on trying to see if we're actually on track.

205
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:31,680
OK.

206
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,670
So let's watch that test again.

207
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,490
OK.

208
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,170
The test is successful.

209
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:36,790
All right.

210
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,600
So it just succeeds because we've gone through everything and I think we've done the right thing.

211
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:46,920
So in the very next video I'm going to go through each and every one of the steps that we've caught

212
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,190
and we're going every photo.

213
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,580
And if you have any ideas about how to make this better I don't hesitate.

214
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,210
Go ahead and share but we're going to go through what we did right here because there's a lot to learn.

215
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:58,680
OK.

216
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,640
So see you in the very next video.
