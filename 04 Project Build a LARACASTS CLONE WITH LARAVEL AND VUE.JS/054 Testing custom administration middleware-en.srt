1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,460
Foster test that you were actually watched correctly it was simply going to pass in or try to visit

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,190
the route like this from our test and make sure that the use is reiterate that accordingly.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,480
So you know are creating serious to us.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,350
We just want to create a new test that sees test only administrators can create serious.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:18,870
OK.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:26,280
What we need to do here is generate a user second visit and point and then assert we are redirected.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,950
OK.

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:34,530
So let's create that user user because factually for use our class and would create the use of a system

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,850
then this anti-Nazis up.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,870
So let's slogging the up to make sure that it's actually I mean the streets are really off them.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,010
The weather feels then we'll try to visit the end points.

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,830
So this last act means last series then we don't really need to pass in the data on right because we

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,680
and the data are going to be parsing.

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,070
We could actually duplicate the detail we have here.

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,820
So I'm just going to copy this army based that in and then I'm going to assert that we actually have

16
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,200
an Air Force session.

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:04,690
OK.

18
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,220
So I said stationhouse.

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,610
And they should match a message saying you are not authorized to perform this action.

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,010
We can also assert redirect to the home page.

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,310
But I think this one would do.

22
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,910
So let's go ahead and run this test singlehandedly.

23
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,210
OK.

24
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,360
So we get a field searching that no much is expected.

25
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,950
This means our session is not actually set.

26
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:28,360
Right.

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,710
So let's go ahead to our administrator me to wear and said that session.

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,800
So if they use ice and I don't agree on the streets or sesshin flush and the key is going to be narrow

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,450
and the volume is going to be exactly the stream that we have in our tests so I'm just gonna copy this

30
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,780
paste start writing and safe.

31
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,450
Why not ask one more time and there should be a difference.

32
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,050
We received the same thing and it looks like it's my fault.

33
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,900
This code is unreachable.

34
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,220
It should be before our return of course.

35
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,940
Run it one more time.

36
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,370
OK.

37
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,750
So we have a successful test.

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,120
That's it.

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,990
It's working.

40
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,700
Bert do we really need to actually pass in all of these dates are in our request.

41
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,400
Let's just pull this out and see if our test is going to work nonetheless.

42
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,700
OK so it works.

43
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:16,710
That makes our task look a little cleaner and we could actually in line this user and bring these streets

44
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,280
online and run the tests again to make sure we do not break anything.

45
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,690
And it looks like we're good.

46
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,710
If we run a test suit just to make sure we haven't broken any other parts of our application.

47
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,350
Yeah.

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,970
We have a couple of failures.

49
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,520
OK so let's go ahead and see what's going on.

50
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:38,970
Field asserting that no matches expected series quite successfully and another bunch of arrows.

51
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,340
So let's go ahead and handle this in the very next video.
