1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,710
OK guys let's do some javascript.

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:09,830
We have our API we have our suites our love which we saw just to have some useful notifications.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:15,500
And we have our player now when they use a finishes just watch a video we want to alert something to

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,870
they use or like a notification message and then maybe we'd like to use to the next lesson or something

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,460
like that.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,980
So let's go ahead and take off that in this.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:28,850
If you haven't installed tweak alert just go ahead and put that in the sausage.

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:35,920
And then for our video player we need to listen when the video completes or when the video is and then

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,450
and we check all the events we have on that event right there.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:52,390
Therefore we had to clear that view and said look we are going to see play that on and then call a method

11
00:00:52,550 --> 00:01:00,210
which is going to be does not display video and then I launch.

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,400
OK.

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,450
So therefore we need to create that mid-thought.

14
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:10,590
So I'm going to create my methods object right here and I need a display region in that search.

15
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,830
Now how would this be.

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,980
We need to display an alert therefore let's fill in the street.

17
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,160
And that might be that we just installed.

18
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:23,910
So in Port street alert from each I lurch.

19
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:37,460
Ok then here we can see sweet alerts and we're going to see Yea you completed this video or this lesson

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,310
or whatever.

21
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:48,230
Ok then we can listen to what happens as soon as the user clicks on the confirm button and once that

22
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:54,120
happens we're going to see window that location across the whole page for now.

23
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,740
OK.

24
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:01,020
So what is happening is when we have this confirmation you need to check out on that documentation is

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,800
really easy.

26
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,200
OK.

27
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,560
For example using pharmacy's we can keep track of how the U.S. are actually done.

28
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,610
So click on each other button.

29
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,610
Although if you click on these Cobar you scored right here.

30
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,390
So that's what we are doing when the user clicks on the confirm.

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,190
We're simply going to redirect that user to the next lesson.

32
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,640
Now we don't have the next lesson.

33
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,780
So let's get to it.

34
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,460
And the easiest way is to get it from our program.

35
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,230
So next lesson you're out.

36
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,430
OK.

37
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,510
Then in our What's that let that be.

38
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,550
Let's pass this pop in.

39
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:49,140
So here we need next mess your all and it's going to be Buju.

40
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,640
We already have the Roxmouth thought that you are soliciting.

41
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,110
So I'll just copy it.

42
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,690
So for the next lesson and then I'm going to paste it right here.

43
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,440
OK.

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,430
So don't worry.

45
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,020
I know we have a lot of queries going on right here but regular facts are to move all of those.

46
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,630
But for now let's just make this work.

47
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,760
OK.

48
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,590
So to make sure everything is working.

49
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,660
So to make sure everything works as aspects that Windows that location is supposed to be equal to this

50
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,440
dot next lesson.

51
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,650
Oh OK.

52
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,510
So automatically when we click on that button it's going to rediagnosed the next lesson.

53
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,940
OK so let's go ahead and see if everything works as expected.

54
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,480
Let's inspect the refresh right now.

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,080
And then let's see you play to see if we have the next lesson on how we do.

56
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:47,870
So I'm going to play this video and then I'm going to ask for it a little to the end.

57
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:58,490
So instead we see that notification and ones that we just completed our play are automatically files

58
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,180
that events and we just play honestly.

59
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,080
Let's now click on this button and everything works perfectly.

60
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,500
This speech should be refresh to the next lesson grades.

61
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:16,950
It's refreshed but we have a problem right because in our pop the way a right here we are trying to

62
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,190
say and get the next lesson.

63
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,760
But this is actually the last lesson of the series.

64
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,540
OK.

65
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,450
And remember we didn't have that error earlier because we rabbits.

66
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,030
In an if statement.

67
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,960
So if lessons get this lesson on if lesson get next lesson.

68
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,710
So but at least we're redirecting to the next lesson successfully.

69
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:44,490
Now what we need to do is only call this last thought if we have a next lesson.

70
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,040
OK.

71
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,490
So we're going to be solving a lot in the very next video.

72
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,800
Clean up a lot of these and avoiding such errors.

73
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,410
OK.

74
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,090
Thanks so much for watching.

75
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,940
See you in the very next video.
