1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,210
As a result of our little math or change in the last episode we have a little problem and we are just

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,700
in the last lesson right here.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,110
As you can see but then you have the next button.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,920
Why is this.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,700
That's.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,650
I watched Blade BHB.

7
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,780
And check this out.

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,150
Remember the way we know if it's the last series is simply by checking if the next lesson is null and

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,870
the same thing with the previous lesson.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,380
We're just checking if it's not.

11
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,740
But this time on we refer refactored our methods.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,530
And they would never return.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,530
Therefore this method would always show the next buttons no matter the lesson that we are viewing.

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,680
So let's simply change this for us to know if this is truly the last lesson.

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,540
Remember when it's the last lesson we would return the exact same lesson we are seeing right now.

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,130
OK.

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,960
So what we are going to be doing is checking if the next lesson is not equal to lesson ID.

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,720
OK.

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,810
So if it's equal it means that this is not really the last lesson.

20
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,150
Same thing with the previous.

21
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,350
If it's equal it means this is the first lesson because remember if it's the last lesson where turn

22
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,190
in the same lesson and if it's the first lesson we're returning the same lesson which is the first.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,750
OK.

24
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,500
So who refresh now.

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,050
And it's not going away.

26
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,400
OK.

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,760
So we should be comparing ID right.

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,890
So we should compare IDs.

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,580
We should also implement that right here and they should also see ID.

30
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,180
OK.

31
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,040
Refresh.

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,920
Very go.

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,170
Looks like it's back to normal.

34
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,320
We don't have that bottle.

35
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,730
If I visit the first we also don't have the button.

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,560
Now I've taken the liberty of doing a little bit of cleanup for an application like the all series we

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,390
have an awesome speech right now.

38
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,880
And recently display was all of the series.

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,450
OK.

40
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,900
So just a page where you can see all the series that are in the application and then for the video lessons.

41
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:59,880
Actually if you check out our whole series and we visit this series and we check out by starting we

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,190
actually have all the lessons displayed here.

43
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,990
So if you want to take this region it's naturally included on the page for the single series.

44
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,230
Feel free to do it.

45
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,930
It's all up to you.

46
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,550
But I want us to actually dive straight into our payments.

47
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,900
Doing stuff with money.

48
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,800
The very very next lesson.

49
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you so much and see you there.
