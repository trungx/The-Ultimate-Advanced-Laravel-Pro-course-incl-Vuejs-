1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,890
Our current subscription process is working.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:08,330
But this is not the best because our user has to wait and we don't even inform him that he's waiting.

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,840
Meanwhile there's a complete It's a long process of API calls going on behind the scenes.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,600
So what we're going to do is we're going to change this implementation a little bit.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,910
So that's the use of with no what he's waiting for.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,100
And the user would naturally receive an indication that what he's waiting for was successful or something

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,690
like that.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,210
OK.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,880
So let's go ahead and poorly.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,280
ST.

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,540
OLPHERTS.

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:37,860
From sweet arm hurt and right here where we are actually making the EPA request before the EPA request

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:47,610
would allow the use of something and the alert would simply have sex off police we weren't we subscribe

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,810
you to our plan.

15
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,020
OK.

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,100
And another option I want to ask here is Bateson's false.

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:02,430
So the usual no we don't expect him to perform any actions and immediately this is displayed the Jews

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,910
request is going to fire to complete the subscription process with our level back end and as soon as

19
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,120
that is complete I also want to notify the user of something.

20
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:20,160
So right here you're going to have this and the text is going to be successful not quite and I'm going

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:27,180
to move this Bateson's false option and I'm going to put in an icon which is going to be success.

22
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,040
OK.

23
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,530
And since our street looks like Regis we promise this we can see that then.

24
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,640
Meaning when the user clicks on the Confirm But so then we can do something.

25
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,640
So for example we want to refresh the page or maybe redirect the user to the less who was trying to

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,460
watch before he was redirected to this page.

27
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:44,960
OK.

28
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,500
So let's just start by saying window location equals here.

29
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,310
OK.

30
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,100
So basically how this is going to walk.

31
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,760
Yes.

32
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,610
When the user receives the token from Strype it's magically going to display this message to the user.

33
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,390
And it's going to be like a mood altering the user to wait and then it's going to fire the existing

34
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,370
requests and wants us to post request we're going to have this success this displayed.

35
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,800
And as soon as the user clicks on the button it refresh the page for him.

36
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,540
And while it's refreshing the page.

37
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,130
OK.

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,230
So the mirror on my end came on watch that we watched a genius next stop to subscribe and point in our

39
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:22,860
browser.

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:30,870
So I'm going to visit the luggin and then I'm going to subscribe putting cards e-tolls month of expiration

41
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:38,390
CBC number and click on the button and like we defined once that API requests or strike client is done

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,240
we have a token.

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,460
And we see this notification message and it actually tells the user to wait and now that the request

44
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:50,140
was successfully made to our server we have this successfully subscribed message back from our server.

45
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,200
And we can click on the OK button and automatically it refreshes the page.

46
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:55,720
OK.

47
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,760
So it looks like everything is working like we expect it to.

48
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,020
And this makes a lot more sense.

49
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,380
OK.

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,870
So why don't we do this when there is a is the page you should actually change that the other is shown

51
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,430
by here.

52
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,460
So why don't we use this page to show the subscription of the user.

53
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,150
And maybe he can change his subscription or cancel your subscription.

54
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,100
In case he wants to.
