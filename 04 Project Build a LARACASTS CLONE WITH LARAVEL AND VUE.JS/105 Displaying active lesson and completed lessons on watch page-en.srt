1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,610
OK let's talk about you before we move on we want to make sure that we know which lesson we are watching

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,330
presently.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,240
And we also want to make sure we know which lessons have been completed or not.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,390
So let's take of that in I watch that later the.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,400
And what we are going to do is actually work in this for each loop.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,950
First of all we want to attach a class of active on the active lesson.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,540
So in this for each loop we have the lesson the current lesson stored in a variable.

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:35,730
And on this ph file we have the lesson that has been passed on to this view in the Vaibhav lesson.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:41,430
So what are we going to do is right here we're going to please an estate man.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:48,670
So doing the loop if no ID is required to lessen ID.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,510
And if then we are simply going to quote aktif.

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,740
So right here I'm just going to see actually.

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,320
OK.

14
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,870
So this is only going to be generated if the lesson in the current loop is because the lesson that was

15
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,320
fastened to this fire.

16
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:09,230
Next I want to display maybe an icon to show that this lesson has been completed.

17
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,260
Maybe a check or something like that.

18
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,560
But now we're going to start simply.

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:22,270
So if our user has completed lesson and will pass in L into that method and then we're going to see

20
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:28,480
and if right here so we can do a couple of things we can have a tick tick box or whatever I can we want

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,830
to have.

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,650
But for now just to keep things simple I'm just going to say we should have a small text that says completer.

23
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,530
OK then you can modify this however you want.

24
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,100
So we check if the authenticated user has completed this lesson.

25
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:47,830
Now we're going to decide in future if we want the user to be able to watch a lesson without being authenticated

26
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,940
but that will come later.

27
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:54,190
And in case we want to use that to watch us with our been authenticated we're going to have to wrap

28
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,310
this to check if there is any authenticated user.

29
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,670
OK because if there is no authenticated use or we don't want to do this it's going to break down.

30
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,120
But now we're sure that the user is authenticated.

31
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,900
So let's just hope with this for now.

32
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,490
OK.

33
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,700
Let's refresh and there we go.

34
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,680
One of them has been selected as such but then none of them have been completed.

35
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:21,130
Therefore we don't see this block let's walk on for having that Ajax request for us to actually complete

36
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:21,920
a lesson.
