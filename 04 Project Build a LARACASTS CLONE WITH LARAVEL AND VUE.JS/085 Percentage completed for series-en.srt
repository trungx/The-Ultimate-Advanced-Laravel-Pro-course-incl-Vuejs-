1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,260
OK how about this.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,750
We want to know the percentage complete for a particular series.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,270
OK.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:12,280
So we should be able to call our percentage completed on the series for a user and would know if this

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,760
use complete or 20 percent or 30 percent or 100 percent depending on the number of lessons that exist

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,980
in the series and a number of lessons that this user has already watched.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,550
OK.

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:35,070
So let's start with a test test can get percentage complete for our series for our use Yeah crappy names

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,030
but they're going to work just fine.

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:37,660
OK.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,630
So looks like we need a fresh ready States or maybe for this.

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,270
We need a new user.

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:47,010
We need some lessons like Lesson one lesson too.

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:53,200
We need to complete this on one complete lesson too and we might have a couple more lessons in that

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,680
particular series.

16
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,470
But we would only complete lesson 1 and 2 then we're going to make some our sessions.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,020
OK.

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,990
So I'll just copy all of this paste and I will just create two more lessons and I'll make sure that

19
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:15,020
I specify that the series ID for these lessons should be serious ones so that they belong to each one.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,600
OK.

21
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,990
So my lesson class for Archie right here.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,430
OK.

23
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,520
So let me duplicate this so I have two lessons created.

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,340
So we have one two three four lessons belonging to this one series.

25
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,490
Now we complete only less than 1 and less than two.

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,900
Therefore the percentage completed should be 25 right.

27
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:47,730
So let's do this let's assert each course and would call use our percentage complete set for series.

28
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,780
So this is the name of the math thought and the past in the series.

29
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,610
And since we don't have the series in this case we'll just get lesson.

30
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,090
I will call serious.

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,620
OK.

32
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,470
So with puss in the series and we expect this math to return to us.

33
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,130
Twenty five right.

34
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,680
So that's good for a start.

35
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:14,060
Let's go ahead and run this one here.

36
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,640
So we have caught on defraying use our percentage computed for CBS mid-thought.

37
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,150
We don't have that.

38
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,980
So copy this to my User class and now we have that my.

39
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,890
And it's sticking in the suits run that.

40
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,470
So I said to not 25 machines expect that.

41
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,510
Right.

42
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,130
So now let's work on this my thoughts you see that it actually gives us 25.

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,760
The expected percentage completed.

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,400
OK.

45
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,640
So we've completed two lessons and two lessons in the series are left.

46
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,710
So what do we do.

47
00:02:51,820 --> 00:03:01,340
That's a good number of lessons in series would be caught are you serious lessons.

48
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,880
I will call the count method because we have our collection.

49
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,750
Yes.

50
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:11,850
Then we'll get number of completed.

51
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,710
Lessons will be equal to.

52
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,960
And how do we get the number of completed lessons we just need to get as members and then get the number

53
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,430
of elements in there.

54
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,710
I read that we receive.

55
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,850
So why don't we do this.

56
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:35,470
We'll use our Get number of computer lessons for Sirius and we'll pass in the series right here.

57
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:35,960
OK.

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,540
So this we are in our User class we would call this so we have a method on this class that can actually

59
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,170
give us the number of computer lessons for our series.

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,520
Ok so now we have this what do we do we need to calculate a percentage therefore to do that we just

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:04:03,110
need to return a number of complete lessons divided by the number of lessons in the series and then

62
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,960
multiply that by 100.

63
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,500
OK.

64
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:11,840
So this is basic math and if I don't get it right we're going to search on the internet to have how

65
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,000
to do that with math OK.

66
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,080
But I think for us to get the percentage.

67
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,810
It's the Pashtun are divided by the total number and then much by about 100.

68
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:27,610
OK so in this case the number of completer lessons would be to the total number of lessons will be for.

69
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,340
So to do other by four should give us 0.5.

70
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,050
And then if we multiply by 100 It should give us 50 therefore that's what we should be expecting right

71
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:36,750
here right.

72
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,540
So we are having.

73
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,100
We are completing two lessons and then we are having four lessons.

74
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,580
Therefore the percentage computer should be 50 percent.

75
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,130
OK.

76
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:51,320
So in a lesson class we just get the number of lessons in the series get the number from teacher lessons

77
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,670
and we turn a percentage.

78
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,240
OK.

79
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,990
So let's run our test again.

80
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:02,570
And now we have this ever seen caught on to find mid-thought get number of completed lessons for series.

81
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:10,220
OK so we need to quit this method and this mathematics in the seeress that's run the test and he sees

82
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,120
fit asserting that 50 matches expect that zero.

83
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,380
OK because this mid-thought is returning obviously the wrong value.

84
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,280
So now to make sure that this method actually returns the correct value.

85
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,100
What are you going to do is therefore create a unit test to make sure that this method works correctly.

86
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:33,530
And then we're going to proceed to make sure that our existing tests that we are running right now succeeds.

87
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,030
OK.

88
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:41,050
So the next we do where we walk on the Get number of completed lessons for CBS test.
