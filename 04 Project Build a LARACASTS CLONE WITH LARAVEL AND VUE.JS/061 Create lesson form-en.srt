1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,300
That so can I quit lesson form copy some from books like here and my crit lesson rather than having

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,970
this body I'm going to have grps right.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,110
So the first one here is going to be for the title.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,480
So the model title placeholder is going to be lessons I don't looks like we need a voodoo ID.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,090
So this is going to be the new video ID.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,350
The model is going to be the joy.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:30,200
Nate Wong for the episode number and we can change S-type to number and see episode number and we can

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,850
actually see how to use this in our application.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,640
Finally a group with a text area that form controlling it.

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,110
OK so we don't need the name neither do we need the ID.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:44,790
All we need is the V model which is going to map to description.

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,470
So looks like we actually need all of these form fields on our class.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,610
Therefore we're going to have our data property or data which returns an object.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,480
And here we're going to have title assigned to an empty string description an empty string a piece of

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,260
Number two an empty string and video ID to an empty string.

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,710
So we should actually have that in a form.

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,280
OK.

18
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,290
So let's go ahead and check it out.

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,190
Quick refresh to conduct and then we have less than V.M. video on the edges of number on the description.

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,240
OK so what do we want to happen when we click on the safe changes.

21
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,750
MARTIN Or we can actually change it to Seife lesson.

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,500
Then she validate the data here and then make that E-Tecs request will serve us receive the lesson.

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,380
Therefore we are going to need to pull the exhaust making requests for import XOs from examples and

24
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,610
we can now use it the way we want in our class.

25
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:43,280
Ok so I'm going to put a pause right here and we're going to walk on the back end on level so that we'll

26
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,350
be able to handle the requests for these components before we go for the view.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,930
Jess.
