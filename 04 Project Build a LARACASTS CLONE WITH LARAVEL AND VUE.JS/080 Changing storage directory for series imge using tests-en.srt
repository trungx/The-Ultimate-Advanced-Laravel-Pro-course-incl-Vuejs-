1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:07,000
One of the great advantages of having a message like we have is that when you want to be facts or life

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,740
gets very easy because all you need to do is write your test.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,020
Keep running the test with factoring and making sure that the test to pass.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:15,610
OK.

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,810
So right now we want to change the way we create series.

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,870
We want to test that the image such we receive in a particular direction.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,570
Therefore we're going to update our test run the test and make the test pass.

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,150
OK.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,170
So a user can create a series.

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,280
Let's start there.

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,440
What we want to do is make sure that it's received in the public directory.

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:41,190
So we are going to update our assertion and our storage facility here.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,530
It's been asserted that exist in the public service directory and the file name is the same the way

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,140
we want.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,930
OK.

16
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,680
And we can go ahead and run this to us now to see what we get.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,680
So run this

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,280
yeah.

19
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:06,680
And we have a failure because it's unable to find a public series this right because it's not in the

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,720
public directory.

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,340
So remember we be factored into our series request the mid-thought that actually uploads the series

22
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,020
image.

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,340
So what we're going to do is come to this and stop publicly as thought within its early to see if in

24
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,410
the probably serious direction.

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,180
That's it.

26
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,470
Let's run our test right now and see if it changes anything.

27
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,770
And we're back.

28
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,190
GREENE So we have a successful test.

29
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:39,330
So we are successfully out of the team and serving our public directory so that every time we want Peachtree

30
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,930
or Sunstone which link is going to automatically link those fires.

31
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:43,470
OK.

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,090
And by default when we deposit or put out into the storage tree and the storage nature has been lying

33
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,390
labo is automatically going to sync with this each.

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,980
Probably no way to right.

35
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:55,820
OK.

36
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,610
So another thing we want to do is make sure that we are updating a series.

37
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,610
The fire is actually deposited in the correct tree after we update the Sui's.

38
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,100
OK.

39
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,330
So let's head over to our update series Test.

40
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,980
Right here we are checking to see if in the series a tree.

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,220
Let's make sure it's see in the public service directory.

42
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:19,920
OK.

43
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,180
Let's run that test loop.

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,810
So copy the name.

45
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,690
Run the test and now it passes.

46
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,350
OK.

47
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:35,750
Because remember how of series request is actually extend indescretion quest.

48
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,220
Therefore everything will change in this which of course also reflects on dishcloths.

49
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:39,880
OK.

50
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,880
So let's run our street now to check if we have anything successful.

51
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,530
We have it and we haven't broken anything.

52
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,450
Therefore every single wish we quits now since the killings are still reasonable.

53
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:58,700
We is going to automatically make it public so we can display it in our views.
