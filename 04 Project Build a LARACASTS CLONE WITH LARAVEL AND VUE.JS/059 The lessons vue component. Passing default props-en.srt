1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,590
Let's go to VGX component that's going to be in charge of lessons.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,240
So right in my companions tree we're going to create a new lessons that you and best for it's going

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,290
to have a template and just to see what's in that.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,130
I'm gonna have a Lessons header and I'm going to export an empty object down in my Abda.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,170
I just need to pull in this component.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,220
Now we just started this view.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,640
Lessons are required now in our template index that need to be collaterally past this lessons into this

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,690
view component.

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,430
So that would be able to give the management of our lessons to view from there.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:34,830
OK.

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,840
So let's first of all Mundus your lessons and looks like we need to pass a default lessons into this

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,420
component as soon as the component is mounted Austin has refreshed the page so we can see default lesson's

13
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:51,750
is the name of the product that we want to pass and we're going to sign these two serious lessons.

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,320
So this is automatically going to pass or the lessons for this series into the default lessons.

15
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,760
Then we need to set up that part right.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,250
So props and we'd have a day for lessons.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,710
But then this is actually going to be received in Jason format because remember we are trying to echo

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,660
objects right here because we have a collection of objects which equil them is automatically going to

19
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,260
cast that string or Jason and Parsee right here.

20
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,810
So what we're going to do is we're going to have a.

21
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,710
And one of them is going to be a lesson's property and it's going to be this dog for lessons.

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,130
OK.

23
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,250
So by default as soon as we receive the props we're going to have a property lessons that house these.

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,470
But then what about formatting that back into the proper object notation.

25
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,220
We're going to have a completed property for that.

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,490
So let's just see for months that in essence it's simply going to return.

27
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,760
Jason don't parse this that lessons.

28
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,460
So that's what we can actually use in our Simply And that's why I have a naturally equity's out of before

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,020
we do that let's make sure that we are truly passing that data and everything is working in our tools.

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,410
So we have a view that stores open to fresh and D'Errico.

31
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,340
We have our lessons and we check out a few lessons.

32
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,120
We have the pool up which is the default which is an for format like expected.

33
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,150
Then we have the data that is exactly this Propp But then we have this formatted license which is an

34
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,260
array of all the lessons for this series.

35
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,830
OK so we can actually look at these and display the lessons.

36
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,040
So what are we going to do.

37
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:26,670
We will pull out this title that we use for testing and in our lessons to the view we want to wrap this

38
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,840
in a container and then have at least.

39
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,100
And we're going to have less good items.

40
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,680
And each of this is going to represent a lesson.

41
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,100
Right.

42
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,350
So we have to simply say we fall and we have to decide what we are looping through and we really have

43
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:47,150
to formatted lessons here so we can see the lesson in adolescence and right here is we're going to acquire

44
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,860
that lesson title.

45
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,790
So let's see if that works.

46
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,570
Quick refresh.

47
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,030
And looks like it works right.

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,100
But there's no styling.

49
00:02:54,110 --> 00:03:00,210
And I think that's because of this as why I'm going to pull it out quick refresh again are working exactly

50
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:00,930
as we expect.

51
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,620
So we have our lease items were displayed from our fermata lessons.

52
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,350
What about commuting lessons and automatically updating this least.
