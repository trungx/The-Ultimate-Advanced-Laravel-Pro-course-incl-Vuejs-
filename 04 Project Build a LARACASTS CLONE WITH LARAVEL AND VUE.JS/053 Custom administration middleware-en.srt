1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,190
This once in our project Lycos is that thinking about how we want to manage administrators and locks

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,120
and use us.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,520
So before we jump students anything we got a quick acustom the weather this week to make sure that only

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,700
authenticated at ministry just can create a series visit the pages to view August.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:24,420
The reason the backhand and Sanch stuff so let's go ahead and Jean who eats or work which we sent make

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,670
middleware at Main Street so you can call these whatever he wants or you want it.

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,070
OK that's what's up for us.

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,380
Buttons are cool if you head over to our administrates or class.

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,570
It's easy to sum up me to where we have.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:42,210
So let's head over to our current on the beat which is for the SGP and we're going to reinstall a new

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:42,840
middleware.

12
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,940
So right on the bottom I'm going to save this as a green class and it's going to be in the broadcast

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,830
HTP media where the retreat and it's going to be up in streets of glass.

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,190
So that's when we just stop let's sit and watch over me to wait and see how we want to walk.

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,980
First of all I would like to create a cost from conflict for our for our project.

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,590
And this is the last talk project based conflagrations and we're going to do this now.

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,280
I don't want to create an administrator or team or unsafe or mistreat dozens in a day.

18
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,980
Therefore I think saving and us in that way will do.

19
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,020
And it's going to solve the policies for this lesson.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,560
Right.

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,450
So we're going to save our administrators and an army and then this may be the way it is going to check

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,870
if the authenticated use or the calling of integrated user is actually in that way.

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,310
Right.

24
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,370
So let's go ahead and do this now for us to quit a conflagration fire.

25
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:39,940
We just need to call into our config directory and create us right config backcross.

26
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,430
But that's the name on the front.

27
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:42,930
OK.

28
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,220
So there it is.

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:51,300
So we just need to create the screens and return an array just like any of the other configurations.

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,110
Be a superscript of each scenario.

31
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:53,550
OK.

32
00:01:53,580 --> 00:02:00,390
So this email is going to contain key administrates us and it's going to contain e-mails of administrators.

33
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,590
For example if I want Cutty for islands of calm to be in the streets or then I'm going to Puchi into

34
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,170
this key.

35
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,640
Ok then.

36
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,230
Anyway project we can actually access this using Loblaws can help our method.

37
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,170
Therefore right here what we want to do is first of all check if these sites authenticated.

38
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,040
Then we're going to check if they use Eyssen and Mean Streets.

39
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,080
If not then we're going to redirect these on to some beach or somewhere would start by saying if just

40
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,190
check that in either the use Eisin in the streets or.

41
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,110
So let's rephrase this Mithal on the use A-Class.

42
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,090
So we get the authenticated user.

43
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,830
In this case we call he's admin and this mythical tell us if they use such Yulian on this region.

44
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,590
So if he's an administrates or then suply then a return next request soon would allow the user to go

45
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,230
to the next stage of the application right or continue to where he was actually heading to.

46
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:57,200
Then if the user was not permitted then reason to return redirect to the home page.

47
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,760
OK.

48
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,370
And also in this case we also want to direct these parts to the beach.

49
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,520
You never want to allow your middleware hanging.

50
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:05,910
Right.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,070
So if this clinician feels it should actually have something to run if not your meter is going to be

52
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,750
hanging really bad case.

53
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,420
OK.

54
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,600
So if they use a authenticates that you go back to the home page if the user is authenticated is not

55
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,320
in the streets or you are Sukumar homepage.

56
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,930
But if the user isn't on the streets then he's going to pass the state of the onion and go to the next.

57
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,190
OK.

58
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,310
So that's Chris that mid-thought use of Ph.

59
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,850
That's great and it's East administrates on it.

60
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,680
And this will simply return Inari.

61
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,540
And this in a real mess don't appear to be mid-thought and takes in and you don't.

62
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,280
And we're going to pass in this e-mail and the haystack is the army itself.

63
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:52,390
So we pass in the email and we pass him can feek back us up a ministry just acida Peyster.

64
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:52,850
Right.

65
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:58,770
So we have an army of a ministry to us which is right here in the broadcast configuration we have an

66
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:05,380
administrator key and it contains an army of all it contains the emails of all administrators.

67
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:11,900
Then in a Yusof class we have this it's a minimum thought simply checks if the common use are actually

68
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,140
useful in the army.

69
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,420
So if it's not on this Army this means it's going to return false.

70
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,140
OK.

71
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:24,610
So looks like our middleware was just fine checks if the uses then it just allows the user to go through.

72
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,730
If not then you choose the user.

73
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,250
OK.

74
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,890
So let's go ahead and implement this middleware in our Vauxhall.

75
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:37,650
So right here we have a group of I mean what we want to do is attach a middleware to this group and

76
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,030
this is going to be the admin made aware.

77
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,800
So this is coming from our cannot appear to be just like the registry.

78
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,200
OK.

79
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:51,370
So this was caught me but cost nothing exactly what with infringing on CROSSFIRE.

80
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,960
So not like that.

81
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,600
This is the route that comes from that route.

82
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,650
So who headbutts where this is when you stop in Iraq.

83
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,580
Try to refresh up each night and see where that's speech because the use us non-acting.

84
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,450
So quick refresh and we were directed it's the homepage.

85
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,850
But if you log in right now we don't have any use of Socky.

86
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,180
I'm just going to read just still want.

87
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,650
So my name is Cotty.

88
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:21,310
Emily Scace of the friends column and the post-war response to stock are direct That's a home and it

89
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,350
actually took a while because I think it's actually sending the e-mail.

90
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,890
We asked it to send.

91
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:31,850
Now let's try to recede at Mitsui secret beach and we actually visited the beach right.

92
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:38,040
Men who come to our broadcast configuration and actually pulled out the issues us email from the administrators

93
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,250
at least and tried to refresh the beach particularly with Democrats.

94
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,310
The home beach Minn. D'Souza Hasan mossies administrator privileges.

95
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,380
So I think for a project where we don't have our means the gist of many rules of administration.

96
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,990
This was just perfectly.

97
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,040
So now that up wouldn't that use a park as an industry.

98
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,380
I'm going to try Visi that vault again and sure enough I have.

99
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,900
So I mean a way it's working perfectly.

100
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,500
Why don't you write some tests for me the way in the next lesson.
