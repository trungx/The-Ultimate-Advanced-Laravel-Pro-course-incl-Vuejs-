1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,580
Let's go one step further we want to talk about getting no math lessons completed for Pensacola use.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:12,840
Let's head straight into it with credits to guide us and this would be test can get a number of completed

3
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,730
lessons for years.

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:15,510
OK.

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:24,930
So how do we want this to look let's just create or use or create a series with some lessons and then

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,270
would create maybe two series with two different lessons each and then complete one of the lessons on

7
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:37,920
each of the series then we count that the number of computer lessons should be I think two or four depending

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,860
on the situation.

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,950
OK so let's go ahead and dive into this.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,530
So not to type out a lot of stuff we need.

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,930
Ready is to last we need to use our we need to serious like we agreed.

12
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,490
So I'm just going to copy all of this pasted in.

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:57,530
So we have a user we have one new series and this series has two lessons.

14
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,630
We have another new series and this one has two lessons.

15
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,270
OK.

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,430
So we don't need this last one right here.

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,640
So our actual step is going to be calling complete Glosson on lesson and also calling complete lesson

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,730
on Lesson 3.

19
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,990
Therefore the number of computer lessons for this user is two.

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,260
And why don't we make this on the list price here by completing another lesson.

21
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,050
So would have a lesson five which is going to be long to Siva's too.

22
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,830
And we're going to complete it.

23
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,790
So complete lesson lesson Phife.

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,380
OK.

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:45,540
So we're going to call this cert equals and we know that expectorate is to easy and we know that we

26
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,250
want to compare against user get the number of complete lessons.

27
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:51,820
OK.

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,270
Or we can call these get short on number.

29
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:54,870
OK.

30
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,590
So get total number of completer lessons is going to give us to turn on my computer lessons on in our

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,400
database for this particular user.

32
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:11,920
So I guess that's actually the only assertion we might want to run therefore let's run this math thought.

33
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:17,260
And yet we haven't ever seen a total of completer lessons is not found on this class.

34
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:25,520
So we're going to copy that headbutts all learning that BHP and create that run the test again.

35
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,700
And we are filled as much as six rocketry.

36
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,450
OK so how do we get the total number of completed lessons we already know how to get the older series.

37
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:42,950
So what we can do is we could get all the series for this particular user just like we did using the

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,850
wildcat.

39
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:51,090
And then for each of these keys we can add the number of elements in the value for this key and then

40
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,830
we'll get in the way of complete adolescence.

41
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,980
I'll see what I mean.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,740
So I'm just going to see results equals zero and I'll quit a For Each loop.

43
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:11,310
So for each keys as key and for each I'm going to see results course results plus and now we need to

44
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,140
get the number of elements that are returned from this key.

45
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:24,390
What I mean is if we had use our won series who won for example and we also had use or won series 2

46
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:30,690
then in this for each loop when we have this one we are going to make a square which already store and

47
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,430
then get the value of this key.

48
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,940
So for example query our database or we're going to have maybe one to three which are the lessons that

49
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,560
have been completed in this lesson in this series and then we're going to count the number of elements

50
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,280
in that avi.

51
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,890
OK.

52
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,920
So I would say Ready's as members will pass in and this is an array.

53
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,210
So we'll call our Cowen's methought and it's going to give us the number of elements in that avi.

54
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,230
So for example if there were three completer lessons in between and then it's going to go to the next

55
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:08,600
step and if maybe there are two lessons completed then it's going to count and give us two elements

56
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,530
and then it's going to continue into these result in Georgia.

57
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,190
OK.

58
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,050
And then at the end of that oppression we can just return the result.

59
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,580
OK.

60
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,110
So I think that should do it.

61
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,380
Let's run a test and see what we get.

62
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,110
OK.

63
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,660
So it's great it's passing.

64
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,150
So to get that number of computer lessons we get all the keys for that use are.

65
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,570
And then we count the number of lessons that are in that are we.

66
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:39,350
When we queried that database on the set and then we add to the result and that's it.

67
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,650
So in the next lesson we should be able to use that data to display the number of completed lessons

68
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:49,020
for use or and also the series being watched for that particular user.
