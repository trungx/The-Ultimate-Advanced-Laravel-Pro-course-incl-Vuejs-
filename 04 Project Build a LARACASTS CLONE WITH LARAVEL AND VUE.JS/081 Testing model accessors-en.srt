1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,980
This your rebuttal application actually using test right.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:10,210
So we write to test making POS and then we see OK this feature WAPs But now we need to see the practical.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,150
So let's create a new series and I'm going to call that yes we can this cause all of those.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,850
A serious image.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,750
And I'm going to put in just cause description right here is the description.

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,220
And in this series and everything works fine.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,260
We should have a new image of loaded into our public service directory.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,270
OK.

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,240
So great series and now we redirect that to this page.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,820
Let's check out our storage directory in our snobbish directory.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,460
Now we have a serious directory and we have the imagery of it.

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,990
But now in our public domain we we also have the storage and we have the series directory and we have

13
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,110
this image also.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,750
So much can be synchronized.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,420
The imagery uploaded right now we have that image publicly available for us.

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,130
So how do we deal with it.

17
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:05,500
Two displays either back to my home directory and we don't have that image displayed.

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,370
So what I would like to do is actually create a lot more access all of these assets is going to give

19
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,660
us the correct path to view this image.

20
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,250
OK.

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,990
How do we create this level so to create this level assets off.

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,920
We are going to be using a unique test.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,430
So quite a unique to us.

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,290
PH We are sun make test and this is actually going to be in our series class so I'm going to make the

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,530
tax code series and I'm going to so level.

26
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,720
It's a unique test.

27
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,660
OK.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,950
So if you head over to our test directory and you tell what you need we would have the seasonal Ph be.

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,690
Now what's the difference between the unit test and the feature test.

30
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,530
Remember our feature set is mostly going to make its DTP request.

31
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,800
So he is dealing with a lot of applications as a black box.

32
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,360
You putting in a request an aspect but love response out.

33
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,170
But then when you Nita's are going to be Methot for cost or class for cost.

34
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,410
So we want a method to function in a particular way and we want a media class to function but to allow

35
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,460
each one unit test at the unit level.

36
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,000
OK.

37
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,760
So the first one is I'm going to test series can get image path.

38
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,080
OK whatever name suits you.

39
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,970
So first of all we need to test that they use that image and get a C response.

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:28,810
And what we are going to be doing is creating a series series because factory and that will be for the

41
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,750
series KLOS will persist that through that data base.

42
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,510
Now I would like to overwrite that before that is creature in the series.

43
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,860
Now let just set my own M.H. you are.

44
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,830
I hope so I can passing on Judy's creator mid-thought and I'm going to see the MHRA all should be set

45
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:53,790
to series and I'm going to see civies small p and G because this is the format that we're using to save

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:05,240
into our database right now what we want to do is want to get in each BAAF to be able to squeeze M.H.

47
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,860
path.

48
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,130
Okay.

49
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:17,060
And we're going to run on a session so US-CERT equals and our expectation is that it should be store

50
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,590
H series series slot that P and G.

51
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,180
Okay.

52
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,340
Because remember we have published to our public directory and we start each series and then the EMH

53
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,050
path.

54
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,690
OK.

55
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:38,590
So we are asserting that this image is equal to the image that we have right here.

56
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,220
Okay.

57
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:45,760
So on I see wristlets we should be able to have an image of property that is automatically going to

58
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,180
get this from the database and actually give us this.

59
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,610
Okay let's run this to us.

60
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,070
PH BE IT FEEL talk to this to us.

61
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:03,370
No notes us executed it looks like we need to prefix this retest so that level knows this is one of

62
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,380
our testifiers and we mean these two series Sest.

63
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,280
Okay.

64
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,840
So let's run that.

65
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,370
And now we have a field test also so what does it say.

66
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,650
CS on able to look at facts you read name test unique Sui's.

67
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,600
So we need to specify our path.

68
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,580
So back to past series class one that says you say tests you need but Kassovitz I'm sorry.

69
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,110
So we have to ask to be checked from that region run again.

70
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,520
And now we have filled our search in that no matches.

71
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,360
Expect that study series three small puji.

72
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,950
Now how do we get this sort of syntax from Lovelle we simply use what we call access.

73
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,550
All right.

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,720
So what I said is we do get something from the database and before returning it to us each week to edit

75
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,370
it in some way or another.

76
00:04:51,550 --> 00:05:01,180
So in our series the BHB we're going to create an accessible public function and formats for us Aussies

77
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,000
get and then M.H. POS.

78
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:12,110
So the case for how we want to use the assets and what that attributes at the end.

79
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,440
So let me ask you which is simply supposed to return to us a particular string.

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,350
Right.

81
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,490
So would return Stone Age concatenates with this.

82
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,160
MH You are.

83
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:26,900
OK.

84
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,070
So let's run that again.

85
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,310
And now the test passes.

86
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,740
But we're using some little magic behind the scenes.

87
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:41,440
So now we have an asset so that we can use by simply calling series M.H. boss and we'll get the correct

88
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,780
path to display that image in our views.

89
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,460
OK.

90
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:52,300
Now this is an option you might want to consider and that is you know a test rather than testing that

91
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,410
the path is correct.

92
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,280
We can test that that you are or is correct.

93
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:04,280
So we can see as I said this because we have a helper said mid-thought unlovable that is going to get

94
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,060
you are all for this resource and we can run our test using that.

95
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,760
Now we have a fitting test because this is what we expected when we use the asset in a thought.

96
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,620
And this is what is returned from our.

97
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:25,140
So we can now Rob all of this in our asset mid-thought run that again.

98
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,620
And now we have a successful test.

99
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,150
Great.

100
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,080
So remember when you're actually testing using the asset mid-thought you're that in the file contain

101
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,360
the correct credentials right here like the you're on.

102
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,130
If not love is going to try to get these you are in the testing environment and if it's not set correctly

103
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,050
you might have a feeling just okay.

104
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:52,950
So that's it we were able to write a new unit test that makes sure that when we call MH but it gives

105
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:59,970
us the correct path to the image now that we have that we can tell us all well that ph we are wellcome

106
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:07,590
and rather than a queen out asset and all of these Longstreet's we can just call Seabreeze get M.H.

107
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,790
path and that's it.

108
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,440
Let's refresh the.

109
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:12,840
Great.

110
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,790
And that's our image.

111
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,540
So looks like what's has successfully told us that we can get the image.

112
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,010
And now we can successfully get that image BAAF.
