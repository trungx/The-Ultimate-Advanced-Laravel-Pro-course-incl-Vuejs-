1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,870
You want to verify that before creating a lesson we must actually passing a title.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,080
So let's go ahead and create a test for that public option.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,830
So first title is required.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,570
Jacqui it's a lesson.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,010
OK so how do we do this.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,780
We need a series a lesson and we need to make that point requests.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,640
OK so I'm just going to copy on the face and paste right here and I'm going to note the title from the

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,150
lesson so we don't need to parsing that title but we need to make an assertion that the title was required.

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:37,490
So right here Atsushi we're going to be making is simply a that the session has errors and this should

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,520
be validation for the title field.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,180
OK so fair enough.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,910
Longinus on Main Street or we might not need this would see through our test and then we Criddle series

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,220
in the series and then I said that the session has some errors.

14
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,400
So let's discuss specifically

15
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:56,670
Yeah.

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,670
And sure enough we have field as such and that force is true.

17
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,720
Now we need to make sure we have some validation right.

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,170
So head over to my lessons controller.

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,230
And I think this one line controllers are really the best.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,120
Therefore I'm going to create a on request for this just so I don't have to include additional lines

21
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,660
like you.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,520
So I'm not with this customer request.

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,780
Be sun make request quick lesson requests.

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,980
Hierarchy that's created.

25
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,790
Therefore we need to create the lesson request right here.

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,840
So Lavallee squinch you actually inject this one you need to encode that.

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:40,990
So use vodcast it's to be requests quick lesson request.

28
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,280
Let's head what's that class

29
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:50,840
OK so let's just say this is true and we're going to see how this applies meathook walks later on.

30
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:56,960
So we'll said that's true just really teach all egressed then for our test to Basri must make sure that

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,510
the title is required.

32
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,420
It's one that says one more time and we still get this error.

33
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,510
Now this is what I wanted to show you.

34
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,910
It still fails.

35
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,330
Why.

36
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,490
Because we're using the Jason method.

37
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,930
Now this post Jason mid-thought creates an environment and this environment is for testing.

38
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,300
Jason AP staff are nothing like sessions actually exist.

39
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,410
Therefore when we checked the session to conceive in the session.

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,010
But if we search this out actually to check the status of the response that we got would actually see

41
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,510
that it's a 4:22.

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,420
That's just the song.

43
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:30,980
Yeah.

44
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,860
On the process.

45
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,350
OK.

46
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:39,350
So we have a successful response as a 1:46 because Lavoe understands that this is a Jasen API in Vollmann

47
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,310
for the testing.

48
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,590
But let's switch this all back to session.

49
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,750
Was.

50
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:50,150
Jason right here and love is going to make and or did not read on normal post request including sessions

51
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,410
and all that then let's run this yeah.

52
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,330
And now posse's.

53
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,790
OK.

54
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,220
So you have to know when to use the post Jason or when you use to post depending on your situation.

55
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,740
In this case the post was just OK.

56
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,810
Now we need to also test that for the description.

57
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:15,930
Let's just get this math on test or title or test or description is required quick a quick lesson for

58
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,330
when lessons are really is going to be read about that description.

59
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,050
Right.

60
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,660
So be studying and pull all the description here.

61
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,890
So I assert that it was for description.

62
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:34,630
So let's run this specific test to make sure it fills in DOS box or quit lessons requests.

63
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:40,290
Or we could just add one additional move for the description to see each required one that tests one

64
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,570
more time and everything should be OK.

65
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:49,070
I'll give you this not one more test for the episode number and then B do ID and I'll test the discussion

66
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,910
is quite quick on this.

67
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,990
So test and it says of number is required to create a lesson.

68
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,720
So rather than these We're going to parse description.

69
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,310
OK.

70
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,880
So I assert that we have arrows for a bizarre number.

71
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,550
Let's run that again.

72
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:05,540
OK.

73
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,110
It fails.

74
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,540
This jackpot of addition will make sure it's required.

75
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,410
And it says Now I'm going to pause for a second for this video.

76
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,110
I'm going to call it a D and see you in the next one.

77
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:20,550
Thank you.
