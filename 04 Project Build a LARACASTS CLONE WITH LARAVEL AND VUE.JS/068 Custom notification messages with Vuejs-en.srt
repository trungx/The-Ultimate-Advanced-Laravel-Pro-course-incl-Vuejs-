1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,800
Let's that go for updates.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:09,020
My thought for lessons now we're going to need to get the series the lesson that we try not dates and

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:14,330
also the request so we don't need the ID in this case quite so large that one article can undo what

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,700
you inject.

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,400
Then how do we want to update this lesson lesson updates request.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:30,550
I think this will do then what we can do is return lesson fresh OK because naturally we just lost a

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,520
billion.

8
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:36,430
Then we researched a fresh copy of that response to our to our friends.

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,550
And so we can actually inject a custom request right here so we can define our addition horse all we

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,150
can actually also define the Venetian host in the control right here.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,470
So let me just read and it's less than request.

12
00:00:51,470 --> 00:01:00,380
So we are sent make requests updates lesson requests if I had about sort of dead lesson requests I'd

13
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:07,640
change the street to room to make sure we have access then I'll head over to my quit on request and

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,880
make sure I also have exactly the same validation what was a good lesson should actually have exactly

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,830
the same by the rules and that will give us a little bit of protection.

16
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,750
OK.

17
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,640
Then we need to all aval to inject rather than the default request.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,130
OK.

19
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,430
So we need a bit less room.

20
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,280
QUEST I would use that at the top.

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,700
So all of the reasonable questions of dogma and then return a fresh copy of the lesson to our front

22
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,050
end.

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,740
OK.

24
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:45,380
So let's head over back to our So these are lessons that you know we have this added button right here

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,880
which is used to update.

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,370
And what we're going to do is add a click event.

27
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:56,790
And this is going to call added lesson and this is simply going to pass or taking the lesson that we

28
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,700
get into it.

29
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,450
OK so let's quit that method.

30
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,250
Added lesson we are taking the lesson now.

31
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,640
We have no choice here.

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,800
We can actually handle the editing of the lesson or we could pass it down to the child component which

33
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,630
has a form that we could use to edit the lesson.

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,210
OK.

35
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:20,200
So I'm just going to say this that image added less an event and the data was going to pass.

36
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,400
So payload is the lesson that we just received.

37
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,100
OK.

38
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:29,420
Then in our component we can actually listen to this show create lesson that you might actually think

39
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:38,150
of renaming this now that has two functionalities but it's OK by me based on parents not on the adolescent

40
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,520
request then begin to do something.

41
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:46,600
First of all that's received a lot which is the lesson that we are trying to educate and what do we

42
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,270
want to do now that art form actually has two functionalities what we want to do is actually manage

43
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:59,440
the state of the forms so we need to know if the form is actually in editing mode or in creation mode.

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,450
So let's just see editing and by default the form is going to be false.

45
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:09,010
Which means it's in question mode then what we want to do is as soon as we listen to this event we want

46
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,170
to make sure editing is true.

47
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,210
And we're going to do a little changes in our template that are going to help us know that the form

48
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:22,120
is editing and it's not creating yet our case so once we do that what we want to do we want to make

49
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,220
sure that the title is set to less than the title.

50
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,010
OK.

51
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,910
The description also is said to lessen that description.

52
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:38,650
Same thing with all the other attributes we have video ideation sets but UAD episode number 2 should

53
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,580
be set to a number.

54
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,590
So this piece of namah.

55
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,140
Great.

56
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,300
So another form is editing.

57
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:53,890
The first thing we can do is actually change the law for this matter so we can say if this film is editing

58
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,460
show us safe less on Butson.

59
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,070
But then if it's in creation mode we're going to change it to create Lassan.

60
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:00,700
OK.

61
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,710
So we can attach and VIF here.

62
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:12,040
So if he was not editing or we could actually attach the arrows just to we don't have to use or not.

63
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,540
And what are we going to do is duplicate this button and right here this is going to have the video.

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:24,370
So if it was editing and we're going to have to save less than what's on display to us and the most

65
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,070
important part we are going to call an update.

66
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,090
Lesson mid-thought on click.

67
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,870
Right.

68
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:37,080
So we have a bottleful gridlocks on one for a big lesson and it all depends on the state of our form.

69
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,060
So if the form is in editing mode then it's going to show the object lesson button.

70
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,650
Awesome.

71
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:48,960
So let's go ahead and quit that mid-thought lesson and for now let's simply say console that lock of

72
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,700
data.

73
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,610
OK.

74
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:58,120
So we listen to an event which is a good lesson and then we transform the form into an editing form

75
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:04,990
by setting this property editing and then we set the attributes of form should be equal to the lesson

76
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,180
attributes that we just got from our parents.

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,620
OK.

78
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,600
Which is going to proceed as a pillow.

79
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:17,210
So let's go ahead and try this out in the Parsa for quick refresh and then click on edit button.

80
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,760
Check out our CRID form which you score that it's automatically populated with the Ditto's for this

81
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,990
lesson right.

82
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,660
So what we want to do is actually open up the model right.

83
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,360
So let's head back to our quick lesson and we'll call this quick lesson.

84
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,090
Open wound up OK.

85
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:40,970
So refresh click on that and sure enough we have a model with the description ID title and everything.

86
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,840
So that's the care of the Ajax request in the next session.
