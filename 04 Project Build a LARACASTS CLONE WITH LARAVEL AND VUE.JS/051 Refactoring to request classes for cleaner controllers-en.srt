1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,670
Like I mentioned a couple of years ago I'm not really comfortable with having a lot of lines in my control.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,510
Actually most of my projects actually make show my controller has a maximum of three or four lines that

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,850
do a paragraphing.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,990
So what I'm going to do is actually extract these image load into my Create Sui's request so creates

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:28,800
a least request that BHB is going to have a public function which says upload Seeley's image and I'm

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:36,150
going to cut out the functionality from my control up and pasted right to sue GET request image is going

7
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:43,690
to be this image because we have to request this title so upload that image use this image file image.

8
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,200
Is this title with the extension.

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,530
And then we stop publicly as Seely's and repassing the finding then what we could do is simply return

10
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,930
this then we're going to be able to actually change this method.

11
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,310
Right.

12
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,620
Then what I want to do is create a public method that says so.

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,000
Sui's OK.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,520
So we have to upload series image.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,740
So I'm gonna copy this functionality out of my class and I'm going to paste this in.

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,560
So upload the image right here.

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,710
And looks like we need access to this finding.

18
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,060
Right.

19
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,060
So why don't we just call this it in this class so that we can actually use it in this other method.

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,340
This filename because of this and we're going to assess this filename and right here we're also going

21
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,070
to assess this finding.

22
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:28,720
OK.

23
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,860
So great.

24
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,430
And then we are assessing this Farney.

25
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:39,150
So now what are we going to have will control our ease request or built image or what was the name of

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,280
that thought of little CBC M.H. And once that's done we want to start Sui's right.

27
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:50,620
That's the methodically right sort of blog Seuss image and the start a series and then return to use

28
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,210
our back and now that we have access to it.

29
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,460
We can actually run a test to see if it's still successful.

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,280
So let's run that on to find three more requests.

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,240
And that should be coming from our Creasey which request let's check that out.

32
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:03,740
Yeah.

33
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,040
So everywhere we have requests we have to switch that out with this this and I think that looks very

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,710
tough that's one that says one more time and we have a successful test.

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,530
So we've actually be factored on the functionality of saving a series into our request class then in

36
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,090
our control we just have a bloats image and store series.

37
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,000
I think that's neat.

38
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,460
Quick Joe.
