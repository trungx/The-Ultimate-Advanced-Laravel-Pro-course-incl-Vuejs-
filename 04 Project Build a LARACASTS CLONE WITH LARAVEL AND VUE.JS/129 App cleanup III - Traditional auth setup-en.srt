1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,630
The next thing I want to clean up is my authentication.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,820
For example if you visit the log in page right now we actually have the log form but and if we actually

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,320
log in we're going to receive the status or key response from our controller.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,180
So that's actually clean up.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,020
So in my log in the blade the Pietropoli I'm going to reload everything and I'm simply going to copy

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,090
everything in the register that let that be pasted right there and then I'm going to edit this form

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,350
such that it fits for luggin.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,830
So right here whether that scene or you have an account we can see no accounts yet.

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,310
And we're going to see registar then the register button is going to see logging and then move onto

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:38,790
the top.

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,970
We don't need that great on going forward.

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,890
We have a password we have an e-mail.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,930
We don't need a name and we need this form to submit to the logging post route.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,460
And they should see luggin working.

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,870
So that's basically what we need to create a log in page refresh.

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,320
There we go that's trying to log in.

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,800
It's going to give us the stutterers.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,960
OK.

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,410
So in log in control or in the authenticates at Mithal this is a method that is in charge of responding

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,530
to the user once he successfully logs in.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,050
OK.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,330
So whether than sending a response that starts with is we are going to check if the request is an AJAX.

23
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,940
So checking the question Ajax is very easy with love or because love will provide us with this.

24
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,910
Just my thought which allows us to check if the cost was an AJAX.

25
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,740
So if it was on Ajax would respond with this.

26
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,050
And if not we'll just return redirect home.

27
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,670
OK.

28
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,100
So let's head over to base and we click on the luggin and we see where we direct that to the home page

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,490
rather than the Ajax response.
