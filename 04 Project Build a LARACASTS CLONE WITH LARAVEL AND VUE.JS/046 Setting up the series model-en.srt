1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,950
I think be good for the coffee just of authentication.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,950
Why don't we go into something much fun each actually has to deal with serious lessons of loading juice

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:10,760
on all of that.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:11,320
OK.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,220
Let's get started.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,560
So looks like we're going to need a serious model for our series which are sun make models TVs and they

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,850
need a migration for that.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,050
Not that's generator.

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,040
Let's go ahead on my question and see what we are going to be having.

10
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,460
OK so I want the series to have a title.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,060
I also wanted to have a SLOC and I wanted to have an image field.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,760
So I'm actually going to be storing the image for all four paragraphs.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,970
I want to have a short description and I think that's going to do it for now.

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:48,510
So we have a title SLOC and this is simply kind of like a a presentation of the title than the image

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,000
or a description.

16
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,830
I'm going to head over to my series model and I'm simply going to make sure that I remove my Simon protection

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,820
so protect that guarded because MTOE then I'm going to generate a factory for this series.

18
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:06,570
I think there are some common the commissary 5:25 for this.

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,550
So P-H be Arsen me factory.

20
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,310
There we go.

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,590
So he would be our sun make for tree.

22
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,620
And this is just going to be serious factory Asaf.

23
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,260
So let's head over to see restruck free and what do we want.

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,110
We want the title and this is going to be focused intense we can pass in a number of words into this

25
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,750
my thought.

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,580
We can also pass in the SLOC and what we could do is actually save the focus and then into a variable

27
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,150
such that Pasquin a title here and then we the title to be watchful focus sentence and we just need

28
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,100
to reference same variable right here.

29
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:47,250
Then for one image you are all we can use this Ficarra image you are on I thought and we can pass in

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,280
the dimensions of the image or just make it for us.

31
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,250
And finally we need a description.

32
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,900
So Flaker Bargo are a record on method.

33
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,290
OK.

34
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,510
So that's a treat.

35
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,500
We can now generate fake Sui's to be able to use both.

36
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,080
And yeah we need to update this right.

37
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,530
So but cause serious loss.

38
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,450
Now the next video let's go ahead and see how we could do accrete beat bit of Britain's elite four series.
