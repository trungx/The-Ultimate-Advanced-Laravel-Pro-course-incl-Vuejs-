1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,740
I don't like seeing Albertson active when we are truly making an Ajax request So let's take care of

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,340
that.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,490
I'm going to introduce a new field and this is going to be a lot in-field.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,970
So your clothing should be set to fall by default.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,340
OK.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,850
So there's no current Ajax request Dan in my computer property that checks if the form is valid.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,880
I'm also going to see check and make sure that it's not loading.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,360
OK.

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,880
So if it's actually loading then this is going to activate the phone right because this is true this

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,340
is true but this is going to be false.

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,870
So if this is actually loading or if there's actually call INS agents request then this is going to

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,420
disable the button right.

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,980
So because this is going to be true.

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,640
True but it's going to be false making the whole thing false.

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,060
OK.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,630
So when we are attempting to logging.

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,150
We just need to set this to the loading Sutro.

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,260
And if we have an error meaning we are still going to be on the phone we just need to see that loading

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,750
was false.

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,860
So no need to do that.

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,590
If we have a successful response.

22
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,200
OK so let's check that out.

23
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:07,620
Now lugging if I put in an e-mail on a password of secrets or let's just say I put in a password that

24
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,720
doesn't match when I click on the button.

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,930
You see just a mode.

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,860
And then we have a 4:22 from our server.

27
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:20,030
And if I change my correct password it's still going to be just a mode to we have a successful refresh.

28
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,640
OK that's what I said.

29
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,890
Now let's think about how we can actually handle responses from our server.

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:32,040
So for example when we have to put you in the wrong password just now we actually received a 4:22 which

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,870
means a fill in validation error.

32
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:41,580
And if we actually head over to authenticates use our strengths that is coming from the field logging

33
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,690
response method because the string of validation exception we the off that filled message.

34
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,100
Right.

35
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,000
So if we actually received Videsh in exceptions for email or password or stuff like that it's going

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,420
to be taken care of.

37
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,190
Right at the top of our logging method right here.

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,720
But then since we are already receiving this because they use those e-mails in on March 1 in our database

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,370
or the password was not correct.

40
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,490
This is of addition exception that begin to receive.

41
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,960
OK.

42
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,650
So what happens when we actually receive this validation exception.

43
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,530
So what did this exception actually do.

44
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,450
If we head over to that class and check out the messages methode all it does is actually populates the

45
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:27,210
area back and then and then it would redirect the use of back with the validation errors.

46
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,080
So in the very next video we can actually customize this functionality to suit our needs.
