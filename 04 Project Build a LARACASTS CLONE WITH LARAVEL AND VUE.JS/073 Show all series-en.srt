1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,290
A project is coming along good.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,900
But let's just do some cleanup just to make sure everything is in place.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,190
I'm going to start by creating a page where we can actually see all of our series.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:10,800
OK.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,270
Head over to my project my series control are you going to visit my index routes and I'm going to return

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:19,310
a view and I'm just going to college.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:27,120
I mean that's series that are great that I mean there are trees series and create and all that blade

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,390
the pitch.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,870
OK so I'm just going to copy the template Baystate as it.

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,150
And it's all serious then for the content section.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,040
We're not going to have a form that would have something like a table which would have a class of table

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,050
that in which we can have a table had.

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,480
And now we can decide what we want to see on the table.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,120
So what about the title and an edit button and a delete button.

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:57,960
OK.

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,540
Just follow them.

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,830
We need a table body which would have table was.

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,820
So looks like we're going to be looking through the table was to have all the civis display therefore

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,670
right here we should actually be passing the series.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,970
So which series will pass and the switch variable.

21
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,020
Therefore we need to get all the series and pass it along so we can actually in line these just to make

22
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,480
sure that we stay in line as archaic weights.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,320
Now in our view we have access to that therefore we can say for each.

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,250
Or we can actually use a 4 or else that will provide for us.

25
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:50,030
So for ours series as available as then we'd have our empty block and the and for hours.

26
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,410
BLOCK OK so if we have some serious loop through each of those and spits out a table but if we don't

27
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:04,670
we'll just have a tech center that says no series yet.

28
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:13,490
Then for this table would have table each hour that echoes all the series title that would of table

29
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,090
data.

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,880
Also with a Butson to the series and it's just going to say added.

31
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,930
So we'll have one for the elites and we'll talk about that later.

32
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:30,510
OK for us to see what we have to watch or what lay out fire and naturally creates a link so we can see

33
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,470
that.

34
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:40,020
So right here in the block let's add a link for weaving all the series and this we just see all series.

35
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,480
And if you want to know the exact route that actually leads to the Sui's control or index My thought

36
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,470
you can run ph we are somewhere at least.

37
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,490
And that will give us a list of routes and where we have.

38
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:57,730
I mean seriously it goes to series that index the index method.

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,160
OK.

40
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:07,780
So in our view of the blade ph we this should point to serious doubt index to view or series.

41
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,970
OK so let's try this out.

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,270
We're fresh.

43
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,910
We have to also reach spots on that.

44
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:15,460
Yeah.

45
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,180
So we have our switch right here.

46
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,280
The title edit button delete button.

47
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:29,190
So I should change this a little to something more visible which will be maybe a Butson info.

48
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:30,410
Yeah.

49
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:30,740
Great.

50
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,890
That looks better.

51
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:36,580
Now let's talk a little bit about editing and deleting our series.

52
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:43,080
And in the meantime we should start thinking about if we want some series to be published or not published.

53
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,600
And we're going to see how we'll manage that.
