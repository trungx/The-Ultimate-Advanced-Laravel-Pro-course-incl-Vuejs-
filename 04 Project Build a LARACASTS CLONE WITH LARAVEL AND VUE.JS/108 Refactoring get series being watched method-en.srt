1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,820
That great let's go to the Swiss bean watch method once again so that everybody can be on track.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,990
Our main aim is to get the series that the user has started watching so that we can maybe told a user

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,340
this or they've recently started series that you've been engaged into it's been updated.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,350
You can watch it right now or something like that.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:19,920
OK.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:26,250
We've saved this series in the database which is the Ready's database with such keys.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,250
OK so you use a one series one which means they use Isen wouldn't you see which one.

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,760
Same thing.

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,510
Same thing for the history.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,680
So we have such keys in our database.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,350
How do we get them from our database so that we can fetch all these ideas and that the user is not watching

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:49,420
this series we use already skees command and the rediscuss command and taking our parts on.

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,670
And there would Franke's that much this pattern.

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,910
So in this case we are getting the keys that match the pattern with these asterisks.

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,510
OK.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,360
And it means get a key whatever key that has user and has the ID of the user.

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,750
And then he has a series and then he has whatever number and get all of his keys.

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,740
So in the case where we have all of these key safety in the database this is what is going to be returned

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,020
to us on our way.

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,100
We actually don't want these keys.

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,370
Right.

22
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,310
What we want is this last digit at the end which represents the society.

23
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,880
So what we do is we create a new army which is called suicides.

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,920
And then we look to all of those keys that we got from the trapeze.

25
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,740
We exploit them using the column and they will disappear supreme effort and then we get the last elements

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,420
of that array which is the idea of the series.

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,290
Now we simply push it to the sorry.

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:36,950
OK.

29
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,020
Now finally we need a collection of series.

30
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,670
So we create a new collection.

31
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,250
We map over that collection and simply return the series that we find from the database using that ID.

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,450
So now when we're talking about refactoring what we could do is actually make this method clear and

33
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,290
more useful.

34
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:02,940
So would create another thought I'm going to call series being watched IDs and this is certainly going

35
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,470
to get the IDs for us.

36
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:11,790
So we move out these comments and this part which returns to us the idea is I'm going to cut it out

37
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,660
and pasted right here so we get the keys.

38
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:23,080
Create a new R-E save all of those keys in there and then we can just return series ideas right here.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,710
OK.

40
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
So we have serious ideas we return them.

41
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,560
So this is an avi of all the ideas of the series that this user has been engaged into.

42
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:39,620
Then right here what we can do is collect this series being watched IDs by clean method.

43
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:46,600
And if we want to make artifacts or rock or shots or what we can do is actually remove the need for

44
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:56,120
this variable and return right here and we'll just change the map function to this method like that.

45
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,830
OK.

46
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,160
So collect all of the ids and then map to them and get the suits.

47
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,650
And like we said when we refracts all or change our code we one that says to make sure that everything

48
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,920
works correctly.

49
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:18,330
So what's my user test and I'll copy the name of that of that test on or run it ph be it future to this

50
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,250
test and get your process.

51
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,500
It means you good to go.
