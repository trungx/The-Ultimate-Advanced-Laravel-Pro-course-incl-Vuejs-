1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:07,240
Get sick of this continue learning Motson first starts us we are going to have a page where you can

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,070
watch the lessons the page is going to take in the series.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,050
SLOC lesson number.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,940
And then when we read the use of that page the Coreg the Jews know that.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,480
OK.

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:23,020
So I don't watch my web that BHB and I'm going to define a new routes.

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:29,770
This watch is going to be a get on it with good to watch series.

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,250
And we're taking the series SLOC.

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,040
OK.

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,810
And he's going to use or control or watch series controller.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,290
And I'll just make it to the index Martha.

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,260
OK.

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,480
Let me create a controller.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,900
He had assigned me control or watch series controller.

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:50,640
OK.

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:58,090
So our watch series controller should have an index method and the six in the series so type in series

17
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,960
right here for Lavell to automatically reject that instance.

18
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,610
So huge but costs squeeze.

19
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:13,990
And then once we have this my thought and the series and that's what we want to do is post starts us

20
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,890
redirect the user to the first lesson of the series.

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,320
OK but we're going to actually be setting up a way so that we can read the way they use us to the latest

22
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,500
computer lesson.

23
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,910
OK.

24
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:30,520
So like if you completed lesson two we don't seem to listen to the computer lesson five the last time

25
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,490
we do it in two lesson eight to Lesson 6.

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,140
Sorry.

27
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,680
So we're going to be setting up the system.

28
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,710
But for now let's just we like to use after the first lesson.

29
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:49,640
So return redirects and wait until we create our routes and we're going to call these routes series

30
00:01:49,670 --> 00:02:00,010
that watch and this route is going to take keen to bomb us to see I will passing serious so.

31
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,740
OK.

32
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,610
Because Rob Mondo Bandi we need to pass this along.

33
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,440
And it's going to take a lesson.

34
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:15,660
Remember our old model mining permit so I will pass in serious lessons.

35
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,960
Chris I will get the idea.

36
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,670
OK.

37
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,200
So let me break this down for you.

38
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,110
It's just an array of departments that are going to be passed to this routes that we're going to create.

39
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,730
OK.

40
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:34,560
So these vultures expecting a serious lesson.

41
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,930
So the series we have easily but the lesson we have to make a query and what we do is we simply get

42
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,640
the first lesson from the relationship right.

43
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,040
OK.

44
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,440
So this relationship gives us the first lesson and then we can get the ID we pass each of our comments

45
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:50,700
on.

46
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,140
OK.

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,320
So we turn to redirect to this Ralph Byrd.

48
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:59,560
In future we're going to have to actually find the final find the latest lesson lessen the use a wash

49
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,180
and then return to the beach OK.

50
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,190
But for us this is good enough OK.

51
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,900
So what we need to do is create that vault that we just specified.

52
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:20,100
So we create a route and this will be Seabreeze permits us series then lesson on permits our lesson.

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,750
OK.

54
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:26,870
And this is also when you watch series control I'm sure lesson.

55
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:35,300
OK then we'll have to give it the name we specified so name is going to be serious that watch.

56
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,910
OK.

57
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:42,710
So like be precise repassing in the suit is the lesson and the name of the route and you see we and

58
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,160
watch like right here.

59
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,620
So serious lesson.

60
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,340
OK.

61
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,210
So let's go ahead and customize that button so it leads to this vault.

62
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:58,540
So would head of ops who are serious that laid the BHB and Querrey half hour consignor learning Motson

63
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,530
we're going to have to increase to include an aircraft.

64
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:04,860
OK.

65
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,540
So why don't we give the other vowels a name also.

66
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,960
So this Vought.

67
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:23,560
So let's just calling serious are and then OK then in this vault we could pass in all routes to Ceres

68
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,320
that learning will pass in the series slaughter house departments such that route.

69
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:30,940
OK.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,400
So when the user clicks on to continue learning Motson it's going to invoke the index of my thumb and

71
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,490
index mid-thought is simply going to redirect the user to the first lesson of that series.

72
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,060
OK.

73
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:52,900
So let's go ahead and click on that button and see what we can refresh click on the Barzun OK it's a

74
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,800
strange property of known objects and online searching.

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,550
This line right here.

76
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,100
So maybe this lessons.

77
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,160
Let's check if we have adolescent's relationship.

78
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,330
So right.

79
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,870
So yes we do.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,360
So the next thing should be this first mid-thought the first A thought is written in or and they we

81
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,960
are trying to get the IGY Parliament's off which means we are trying to get a property from a known

82
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,580
object.

83
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,440
So looks like we need to go over.

84
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,900
I mean and actually save a new lesson to this series.

85
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,010
Parcak like I thought this has no lessons so let's create a new lesson.

86
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:40,890
And this would be introduction to view just 2.0 or 2.5 and then we just pass in a fake video ID and

87
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,230
the episode number is going to be 100.

88
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:51,040
Dozens of asked in five V.M. ID this and then we're going to see that's true Jussieu.

89
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,880
So this awesome framework.

90
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,140
OK.

91
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,690
Then create a lesson and you have lesson created successfully.

92
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,350
There you go.

93
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,820
We have our first lesson Ladd's receipt.

94
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:12,870
Our home viscid dot series and click on the consonant learning Motson.

95
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:20,150
And now we have redirect that to series VGX lesson 1 and then we don't have the short lesson method.

96
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:26,770
So that's created now what series we're going to create a public function.

97
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:34,620
Sure lesson my thought and we need to receive the C race and we also need to receive the lesson now

98
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,160
or less.

99
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:40,600
And we just need to avoid that so we don't have any worse than what we do right here.

100
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:51,780
We turn of view so return view we should be watch and will pass in to permits us a civics lesson.

101
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,920
OK so we may not need to pass in the series lesson because the lesson we can get the series but we're

102
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,000
going to come back and be shocked in a little while.

103
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:00,590
OK.

104
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:07,610
So just to save us a lot of time I actually created a watch that made the Peachtree already in my home

105
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,570
my view woodstove tree.

106
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,500
And then right here we just have the stand that simply.

107
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,590
So here we need to equal the lessons itl.

108
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,540
So I'm just going to say lesson time to home.

109
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:27,450
And then here we have serious title SCMS and the speech arts of his title and right on the button.

110
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,610
This is where we're going to be putting our play and all that good stuff.

111
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,280
OK.

112
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,900
So let's refresh this link once again and grade.

113
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:40,580
We have these page introduction to you just 2.5 VGX beginner costs.
