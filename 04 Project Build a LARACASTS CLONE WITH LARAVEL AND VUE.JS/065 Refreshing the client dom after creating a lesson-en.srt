1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:06,160
Let's make sure other vigilantes are truly required and then we'll move on to something else and get

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,380
this and make sure that the video ID is passed to quit the lesson.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:20,020
So of this episode number in Boston and expects to be in a session was run this Singo test

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,010
to mission.

5
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,090
Let's fix that Rochester gang.

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,490
OK now it's fixed.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,630
We might actually have to come back today to make sure that we verify that it's a valid ID or that the

8
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,200
number is unique.

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,380
But let's go ahead and move on.

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,480
And then we're going to come back to this later on.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,750
Now what do we need to do.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,540
We successfully verified that we can actually create or store licensed university.

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:54,420
But wait what are we going to do now is head of a create lesson that view and take it from there.

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,940
Now when we make that post request we actually create it.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,650
We have the response detail right here from the server.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,450
What we want to do is image of an event that a parent or we got a successful response do something about

17
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:06,870
this.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:14,650
So we're going to be meeting an event called lessa created and then the data we're passing in is the

19
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,490
response to data.

20
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,270
Remember this is going to contain a lesson that was just created.

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,710
Now when we meet this event we need to listen to this event from our parent which is less instant view

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,120
therefore we need to hook into the Mount that Huq lifecycle.

23
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,920
And what we are going to be doing here is subscribing to that event.

24
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:43,450
So this is not on the lesson created which is the name of the event that is emitted from our child right

25
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,650
here same event with a callback that will be as Accu-Chek and we're taking the lesson.

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,220
So Parminter and what we want to do is actually update the data property.

27
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:00,070
I notice that we are actually parsing these Jason right here but it's fairly possible to actually it

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,810
in line right here which is going to give us a lot more flexibility.

29
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,460
So I'm just going to just in the past the study for lessons right here and I'm not going to need this

30
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,390
computer property anymore.

31
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,810
And right here I'm going to make sure we use the lessons in the loop.

32
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,040
OK that's a little bit of a Prato and it's going to give us the flexibility of doing these days and

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,920
lessons that Bush Leser.

34
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,530
Right.

35
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,900
So when we listen to the lesson create an event events let's push that new lesson into our own lessons

36
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,790
object and jazz as glass test.

37
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,980
It's going to automatically refresh that door.

38
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,740
OK.

39
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,760
So one thing we want to do actually in our quick lesson is to close the model.

40
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,290
OK.

41
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,940
So let's go ahead and do that.

42
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:52,350
And then the idea for that or worse create lesson and we'll call the model Mfat and passing a high parameter.

43
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,650
OK so that's going to.

44
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,650
Hold on for us.

45
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,880
Let's go ahead and see this in action.

46
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,490
Quick refresh and we have no arrows.

47
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,840
If we actually trench coat of your lessons we have the lessons object right here that is automatically

48
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:13,450
cast or passed into javascript array and we call on a quick lesson let's just see have a new lesson

49
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:23,110
parsing any ideas passing in episode number and then our description is going to be whatever.

50
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,730
So let's save the lesson.

51
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,710
And it looks like a cluster model but for some reason it didn't pick up on that event.

52
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,100
Right.

53
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,910
So let's see what's going on and make lesson yet when you actually listen into nests and create that.

54
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,410
And I think the error is coming because we really have to specify that we are emitting to the parent

55
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,360
of this child component.

56
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,800
So does the parent that I meet so emits particularly to the parents and the events should be lessened

57
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,370
created.

58
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,290
Let's try that one more time.

59
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,730
Create less than paste in the description in your ID please.

60
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,420
Id create and automatically we see that our home is refreshed.

61
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,540
OK so that's pretty great.

62
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,050
We actually successfully pushing this are we.
