1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,590
Self-love five point five.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,780
We actually have the possibility of it in our own cost time extension exceptions and so that we will

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:12,240
have complete control over what happens when we throw this exception that squarehead and use that to

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,130
our advantage.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,610
First of all I'm going to have to watch my exceptions I'm a tree and I'm going to create a new custom

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,500
exception.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,330
So like innocent we see logging field exception.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,080
We or rather just change this to us.

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,320
Maybe we might want to use this exception also with arbitration.

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,590
So Orfield exception and right here we see we simply need to create a class and extend the base exception

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,220
right.

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,750
So who's Celan namespace two are exceptions.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,370
And now that we hear something or like to do is actually change our application name so we Arisa an

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,530
app name and I'll change that too.

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,280
But cost.

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,030
OK so now that we've changed that we no longer have our.

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:02,310
But we have but cast's exceptions then we can now create a class called off field exception which extends

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,180
the exception class.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,880
And what we could do is actually pulling the exception for sea level for rights Cross.

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,540
OK so now for Lavoe to be able to actually render exceptions in the carets we will need to provide two

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:15,990
methods.

22
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,820
One is a report method and the next.

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,900
So when the method.

24
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:19,360
Right.

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,810
And this report method is going to be taking care of maybe reporting our error also exceptions.

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,410
So services like custom logger when obvious in production or whenever we want.

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,190
But in this case what we just want to do is handle this exception in our application so we're just going

28
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,350
to say set up a public function render.

29
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,220
We're not interested in reporting obligation all the parts in the exception so this random thought is

30
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,470
simply going to return a response.

31
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:53,640
So each response Jason on what actually said the status school 2 4 2 2 and here we need to pass in an

32
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,520
army of data so we cannot dominie's are we by seeing what detail we can actually parse into this class

33
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,170
and when are as an error.

34
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,750
OK so let's try to see what we have let's head of about authenticates user and what level does this

35
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,240
actually uses the translation files to render that response.

36
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:17,980
So if we just head over to our resources long directory and head of that BHB This is the message that

37
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,380
actually sends this credentials to non-Markov records.

38
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,430
We cannot really use this by default.

39
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:31,500
So let's just head over to our field section and let's just see we set up a message key and this is

40
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,280
going to be called to these credentials do not march of Eckhardt.

41
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:35,730
Right.

42
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,070
Because remember this method is only going to be called in the case where either the use of password

43
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,290
is not correct or the email is not correct.

44
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,740
Right.

45
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,140
So we need to simply on our ideas mid-thought and call of our own custom exception.

46
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,450
So backing of a logging controller I'm going to base this right here and rather than to any radiation

47
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,740
exception I'm going out for a noon off field exception.

48
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,590
And for now we don't have any palmettos that we're passing into this method.

49
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,410
OK.

50
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,680
So at the top we need to pull that in.

51
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,390
So use but coarse exceptions of field exception are.

52
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,450
So let's try this out.

53
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,260
If everything works perfectly we should actually receive a response with this message on the status

54
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,590
of 4:22.

55
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,920
So let's try this.

56
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,470
So log in my row and I'll paste in that e-mail was a wrong password and see what we get.

57
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,670
Sure enough we have 42 like before but let's go to our Anette what's up and actually see the data that

58
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,450
we received.

59
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,430
So we received a message property which say these credentials to non-match are records.

60
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:44,820
So it means our custom exception is actually being called and since we can actually override all the

61
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
methods in a lot of things could use us traits.

62
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,470
This gives us a lot of flexibility to do whatever we want with our application.

63
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,960
OK so we are successfully getting this message.

64
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,410
What do we want to do when we receive that Carol.

65
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,780
For now we just console that log in but we need to give a little feedback.

66
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,710
All right.

67
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,390
Let's take care of these in the next video.
