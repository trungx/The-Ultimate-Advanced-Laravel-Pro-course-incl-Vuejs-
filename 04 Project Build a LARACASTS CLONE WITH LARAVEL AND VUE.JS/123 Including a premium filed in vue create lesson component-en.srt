1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,290
Next step we've included a Boolean field into this table so it only makes sense structurally updates

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,250
are a form for creating the lessons and updating lessons so that we can actually change a particular

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,420
lesson from free to premium.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,000
OK.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:21,620
So first of all head over to my lessons class and right here I'm going to set this to be called that

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,170
you are false because we want our lesson to be by default.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,810
In case we don't want it to be a premium.

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:28,350
OK.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,920
So next step looks like in our data we need premium we such a force by default.

10
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,390
OK.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,140
We need a checkbox field so I'm going to head over to or from and have consistently duplicate this form

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,670
go pull this out.

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:48,110
And for now we're going to do with a simple checkbox I will bind the model to be of course to premium.

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:48,640
OK.

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:55,690
So automatically once you said that it's going to send the data to form which means an eye level site

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,590
would also be receiving that in this right here because we are in the complete lesson object.

17
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,730
OK so let's save that to a browser refresh.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,180
Click on the Edit button and there we have our checkbox right there.

19
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:08,750
OK.

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,370
So we're going to actually set up a label right here and this is going to see premium and we'll call

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,940
it lesson that freemium right here.

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,490
OK.

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,130
So refresh click on click and edit lesson.

24
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,360
And when you click on these we have premium.

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,360
And automatically it's going to go that field in our database.

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,860
OK.

27
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,570
So this is what we want close this kid a new lesson.

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,660
Automatically such a premium for us.

29
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,120
OK.

30
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,960
So this looks like it works as expected.

31
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:46,260
The Shikata request when we make that Ajax request to create a lesson it's to past the lesson objects

32
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,000
which means nobody is receiving that field.

33
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,560
Also a good lesson does the same thing.

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,740
So we could go.

35
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,360
So next day is to checkout our lessons controller and look at what we have.

36
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,420
So let's head over to or create lesson.

37
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:08,430
So it's so surprising request all meaning it's going to persist that they are paid less.

38
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,450
And he's also passing in requests all OK.

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,310
Looks great.

40
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:18,010
Some lesson as a premium lesson and then see what we get because I have all of this see that top and

41
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,640
automatically offset the premium to false.

42
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,170
OK.

43
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,510
So I added this.

44
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,490
So this is true.

45
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,510
Cephalexin.

46
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,280
And then click on that.

47
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,550
And once we get the response from the server we see that is systematically set premium to 1.

48
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,040
Ok means this is a premium lesson.
