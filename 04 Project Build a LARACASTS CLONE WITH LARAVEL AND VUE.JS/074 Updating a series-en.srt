1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,400
Let's think of what we need to update our series for example your credit series you want to edit the

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,200
title where you want to edit the image that was a blow that I think this is going to give us a little

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,530
bit of opportunity to learn something new.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,060
So let's dive straight into it.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,640
So obviously we're going to need a viewer for the edits.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:23,730
So I'm going to create a new view in my scripts directory that I'm going to call edits that made me

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,200
and it's going to look exactly like the Crusades except that we're not going to be creating.

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,020
But we're going to be editing an existing series.

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:38,790
So looks are we going to be passing that series in to this view.

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,400
So it would just acquire the series.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:51,410
Sayto So we know what we are doing then and the templates we're going to redirect this into puts requests.

12
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:57,620
Leave the CSR field and for us to actually make pooch's request we need to tell Lavoe that the methought

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,010
field is a portal.

14
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:06,270
So right here we are going to echo Methley field and Puss in Boots.

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:15,590
Then we have our title so we can assign the value of this title to be equal to the series title that

16
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:22,110
was passed into this view and we have our EMH and we have a description.

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,790
So let's call the correct description right here.

18
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:32,790
And the basic idea is when we submit this form it's going to update the title and the description.

19
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,170
But then if there is no fire fuel then it's not going to update that field.

20
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:37,770
OK.

21
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:43,350
So we need to direct this to the correct routes and pass the correct parameters.

22
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:50,180
If we check out our route list to update a series we put our patch request we submit that series pass

23
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,120
in the identifier and we are using our SLOC in this case and he has the point to see just the updates

24
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,920
and the screen to the update method.

25
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,430
Right.

26
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,280
So serious the updates is what we need.

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,900
We need to pass in the series log as a parameter.

28
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:09,020
So our automatic round model binding can take health.

29
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,800
And I think that's all we need to do in our funds.

30
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:18,460
Then we'll head over to our service controller and first will attack ads added my thought which should

31
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,760
we turn that view.

32
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:28,850
I mean serious as it is and it has to go with the series and we can automatically type in series right

33
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,940
here for a lot of water injected.

34
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,540
Great.

35
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:39,330
Then the update method which we're going to be taking care of that later that's just died down requests.

36
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,290
Okay.

37
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:48,260
So last off in our order blade the Peachtree where we have this table we need to pass in the correct

38
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,570
permits us.

39
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:55,380
So this should go to our routes which should be series that added.

40
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,030
And I think that's what we have.

41
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,050
That's what we have and U.K. as a parameter we should be a series SLOC.

42
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,780
Okay.

43
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,720
So let's try to sound refresh this page.

44
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:16,140
We have if we click on it it takes us to edit this series and then it gives us the title the field where

45
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,460
we can change everything and the update button and clicking on that makes a get request.

46
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,220
I think I know why that's because it's supposed to be a post request.

47
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,590
There's no such thing as a put request lovely automatically going to recognize it by the method field

48
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,290
right here.

49
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,020
OK.

50
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,770
So go back and then click on the updates.

51
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,690
There we go.

52
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,850
We have the data from our phones.

53
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,360
OK.

54
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:46,050
If we're actually to do or download or see a picture they're going to have an instance of upload that

55
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,120
fire right there.

56
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,570
OK.

57
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,340
So let's recap for updates.

58
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,570
First of all anti-Hindu is forced to have the series.

59
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,560
Now that we have the series.

60
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,890
We can update its properties now.

61
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,960
I would like to create a custom update service request where we can actually customize or take care

62
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,050
of everything in the background and validation and all of that stuff.

63
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,660
So I'll create a request.

64
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,320
He had to be sign make request or date Sui's request.

65
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,750
OK.

66
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,610
So if you had a Ratso update series request authorize or said that true.

67
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:29,380
Now the rules should have a title which must be required and a description which must also be required.

68
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,980
So we are not required to actually upload an email when we are dating but the title and the description

69
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,250
fields must be passed in the request.

70
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,550
Now I'd like to show you something we have some request right here.

71
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,580
We have our update series request and we have a quick request.

72
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,170
And if you check out our Queechy Richard Quest.

73
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,620
It has this long series.

74
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,470
MH mid-thought and what is this image mid-thought.

75
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:01,890
Is it loads the series on Sawston the name in this file named property on this class.

76
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:08,400
Now I want to use this exact same mid-thought so I'm going to copy it but I'm going to be all in the

77
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,590
new hour so I'm going to show you what I'm doing.

78
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,180
First of all copy this method to my update series and I'll paste in that thought.

79
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,070
So it's going to blow the series if we have image of that.

80
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:29,670
So in my control or what I can do is check each request house fire then would call request or bloats

81
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,960
series EMH.

82
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,740
OK.

83
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,280
So we have this image on the updates was the PH B.

84
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,200
So what are below the EMH.

85
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:45,270
And then once the image is below that we'll have this filename set and we could automatically do this

86
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,090
series.

87
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,890
MH You are all equals requests of us.

88
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,850
Imagine then will get the foreign name.

89
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,330
OK.

90
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:00,510
Because we actually set in defining property on this instance.

91
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:07,220
OK then we'll have to set the title because we know the title would be in the request.

92
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,140
I would also have to set the description.

93
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:15,010
And finally we need to update the series SLOC field.

94
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:24,240
So I would call the string SLUB method or we'll pass in the request Sithole and we'll just call series

95
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,310
Safe finally to posses that data.

96
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:34,710
And finally after we successfully see if the series will just return redirect to a route series that

97
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,840
index.

98
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:43,380
OK so first we check if there's an image if there is an image ablate the image you are fueled and we

99
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:49,920
are below the MH and then we update the title description slogs safe with the use up to the page where

100
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,370
he can view all the series.

101
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:51,870
OK.

102
00:06:51,900 --> 00:07:00,240
So here we have all our series and I'm going to edit this one so I'm going to edit that title to maybe

103
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,570
best novel cost.

104
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:10,560
Change the description to maybe description of best novel cost and then upload a new series.

105
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:20,130
Maybe this one and then curricle ablate series and comments can be debated here we can see already that

106
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,120
this was at the top of the title.

107
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,800
So what do you want to check is if your image was actually as.

108
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:36,190
So I'm going to get all the secrets and if we cecal this one we have the slug of data or title of data

109
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:41,450
the image you are all also points to best level Casta PMG.

110
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:47,060
You check out the email in our story page there we have it.

111
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,470
So looks like everything is working as expected.

112
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,840
But in the very next video what I want us to do is go through this exact same process but when we go

113
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,830
into it using our test.

114
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:03,380
So we want to make sure that everything is walking like we wanted to work.
