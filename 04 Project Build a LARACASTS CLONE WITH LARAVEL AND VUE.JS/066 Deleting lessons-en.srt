1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,890
Let's straight into the reach of Zlitan a lesson from this dashboard.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,390
Oh and by the way be on the scene I took the liberty of including an Edgerton's and Pazza.

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,370
OK so let's use the delete button to make this happen before we do that.

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:18,780
Let's just head to what some lessons can twirler and make sure that lateralis prepared to delete stuff.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,500
So right here where have to destroy is expected on ID.

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,240
But we use an outmoded Banyon So we're going to get the lesson.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,870
So lesson lesson remember we really just not a resource and automatically we can tap into these anomalies

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,680
can inject to us a lesson.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,190
So that's important.

10
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,130
We just need to call.

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,070
Let's see.

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:40,690
OK.

13
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,830
So hopefully we don't run into any trouble.

14
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,580
Let's go ahead and make this happen with XOs.

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:52,890
So you know the lessons that you have this is the need boson therefore we cannot part an event is not

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,520
which is a clique which concedes you need that lesson.

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,610
OK.

18
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,410
So this and I thought we need to get right down in on my thoughts.

19
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,260
Object would create that thought.

20
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:08,130
And what we want to take up from today is that Mitchell he actually wants to debate so I'm simply going

21
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,430
to rubbish in a confirm.

22
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:17,960
So if confirmed Are you sure you want to do it and this is kind of using javascript's for API.

23
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,010
But I think it's going to stop the policies.

24
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,300
So you want it to lead.

25
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,760
And that's true.

26
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,750
This is a show he wants to delete.

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:31,010
Then we're going to make an egregious call so egregious that he needs which is a delete request.

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,730
Looks like we don't have access to use on this component yet so let's imported.

29
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,020
You bought yours is yours therefore exist to delete.

30
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:47,480
And we need to pass in the end point therefore with passing I mean this series ID slash them we need

31
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,700
to pass in the lesson ID right.

32
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,430
So why don't you get the ID from the loop.

33
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:59,120
So right here we can possi it as an argument therefore we have the lesson local variable and get the

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,690
ID.

35
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,510
OK so we passed a less than ideal to this method.

36
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,970
So once we get that we can in also as the Bonneton.

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,140
And this has to be fixed reconnoissance.

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,770
So I mean suicide the lessons lesson ID Justin's delete and point down we want to reach.

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,010
And if you're not sure about that.

40
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,870
Make sure you want.

41
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,030
We have seen Margolese and checkout zeolites routes we have.

42
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:27,920
So let me use my I.D. lessons and lesson and squinch go to destroy mid-thought of innocence.

43
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,630
OK.

44
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,310
So that's what we have done den.

45
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:40,380
If we have a successful response console that Lauck response just from now and Gutch it's also going

46
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,010
to do so.

47
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:41,650
OK.

48
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,070
So let's try this out.

49
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,120
Quick refresh.

50
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,780
Open up my console.

51
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,120
And that should delete this one.

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,690
So we have.

53
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,850
Are you sure you want to delete.

54
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:56,540
It's gone from and we have a good 500 Let's see what that is index a global is still not going to pass

55
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,640
to license.

56
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,810
That was supposed to be an instance of a lesson but received an instance of my class.

57
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,450
OK.

58
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,410
I thought that was going to be a problem.

59
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,140
That's headbutts NASA's controller and trying to see if the series.

60
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,500
And also we see them lesson then we do need the lesson.

61
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,170
OK.

62
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,240
I think this is going to fix it that Shrub did it again.

63
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,880
OK another error.

64
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,280
And Greg you actually deleted the response that must be a stream.

65
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,780
OK.

66
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,600
I knew this was also going about because we can't reach on the internet control us.

67
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,840
So what we can do is listen to meet and return a status of OK.

68
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,440
So response.

69
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,620
Jason sconces OK.

70
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,120
It's just a successful response.

71
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,370
OK.

72
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,430
So we found a series Find the lessons to lead the lesson and respond to this.

73
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,870
So I don't think a lot of long ago this was actually a problem we could actually typing this a novel

74
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:05,050
was automatically conject of the lesson acknowledging the series but that's how he wants to work now

75
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:05,870
then it's OK.

76
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,470
OK so let's delete this.

77
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,750
I think we already did.

78
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:17,930
Let's help refresh translate this one OK so it looks like we're successful and we have to delete a response

79
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,640
that.

80
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,390
OK so that was sucessful leagues in 18.

81
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,020
But what happens to.

82
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,230
When we actually have an elite where Spawn's.
