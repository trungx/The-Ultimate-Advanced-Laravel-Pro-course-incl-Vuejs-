1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,270
OK let's work a little we don't follow us.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:09,630
Now I want to get the class extension and make sure I Possy into this name concatenated so requests

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,070
M.H. get a regional extension.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,340
Squeege give us an extension but rather than making two calls to our request last we can just naturally

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,960
see these into available.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:26,510
So we're just going to see that image Igor's request M.H. then we can reference this right here and

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,050
do.

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:27,420
Right.

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,670
So we get to that image so it publicly.

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,040
Another option for us is to use us.

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,580
So my thought and Mitchellville story into the public disk but we'll look at this little one between

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,350
the just fleeting images.

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,720
And then it starts into a series directory on the name of the fire east the strings long for the title

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,560
and it attaches the click and regional extension rights and forms of PNU is going to such that if it's

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,930
GBG then you're going to touch that.

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,080
OK so once that is saved we now know the name of the file.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,930
So this is the name of the father it's going to be saved for us.

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,490
Right.

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,440
So what we could do such really see a name right here because this and then pass in finding and rather

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,900
than saving the e-meter or a sergeant making a saving us service because we know that it's going to

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,290
be in the service directory then concatenates will probably.

22
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:16,920
OK.

23
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:23,910
So we have the file which is that far loaded in each instance we get the found him by attaching title

24
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,110
street SLOC version to the original Klann extension.

25
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:34,770
And then we loaded the file into a directory and passed the filename and then we created the series

26
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,030
and why quitting the series.

27
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,150
We make sure we specify the image or a series concatenated with defining and we redirect the user back.

28
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,530
So let's try this out in the browser and see what we get.

29
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:50,370
Another series below the file and I see another series description which you wish I were redirected

30
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:50,790
back.

31
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,260
Now let's talk about food.

32
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:58,560
So in our story each up there actually we have this and JP G which isn't.

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,310
So what we should make sure we do is actually have a full stop.

34
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:10,430
MITCHELL That's an extension and that's going to fix that error then let's use CT to check out our database.

35
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:18,480
We are Sun Shingo and we're going to get that cost series and I'm just going to get our Okay so it looks

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,460
like we're all actually was successfully possed but without the points right here that's as simple as

37
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,520
what we made or finding changes.

38
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,340
Right here we are in this extension and then looks like everything is going to work out.

39
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,230
So try this all more time and then they're going to write a feature to us to make sure it works.

40
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:43,620
So final series in our series description of the fire great series where we directed back checkouts

41
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,810
in car and looks like we have a Jeep that is Miss height for imagery.

42
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,980
Check out the file extension.

43
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,520
And sure enough we have an image that was on Lol that looks perfect.

44
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,540
So was actually quitting a series is walking.

45
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,490
Why don't we write some features as to make sure we never break anything in future.
