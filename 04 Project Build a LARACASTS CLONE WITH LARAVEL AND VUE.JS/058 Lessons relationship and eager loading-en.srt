1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,550
All right let's get into a fun part.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,040
This speech is going to have a quick update and the lead for our lessons.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,760
Why don't we start with the read so before we start with the read.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,280
Obviously we need to have some sort of coalescence into our database before we proceed.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,120
So let's go ahead and create a class for our lesson ph meet our son make factory less factory and would

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,950
pass in the mother and all of all we are doing that for the lesson class.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,550
OK.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,490
So we have a lesson factory and we can customize it the way we want.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,040
So first of all we need a title for the lesson.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,580
So it's fake our sentence.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,360
We need a shut description Ficarra a paragraph and suicide.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,010
He also writes for series Id shoot up a series.

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,490
So why don't we do this.

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,280
An anonymous function that returns a suicide.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,400
So we're going to call our factory and it's going to create one for us and give us the idea.

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,060
So what is the question for us your cretinous Kurus series class.

17
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:05,010
OK so suicide is going to call this serious Jenna itto generate a fake ID and then give us the ID.

18
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,550
Ok then what else do we want.

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,710
Episode number.

20
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,640
I'm just going to what could these two hundred maybe.

21
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,220
OK finally we have the video I.D. So let me go ahead and put that in the video ID.

22
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,840
I'll just head over to Vimeo and grab whatever I see.

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,710
So get this one.

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,310
And here's the I.D. OK.

25
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,600
So we set that's used to generate some fake lessons on Peachtree areason tinker and factory.

26
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,150
But cost less and class create.

27
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,460
And why don't we quit like five of them.

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,280
We need to migrate to our database.

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,570
Right.

30
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,510
So we understand my grid fresh aasan.

31
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,250
So Team car again and we did that yeah.

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,890
There we go.

33
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,070
We have five lessons in our database that's go ahead and see that and I'm going to get a slot for this

34
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,420
series right here.

35
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,330
How about this one.

36
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,890
And I can go and visit that series in my browser.

37
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,280
OK.

38
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,390
So there we are.

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,580
Now what I want to do is load all the lessons of that associated with this series into this page and

40
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,100
then automatically a view component is going to seek the detail and then do its thing with it right.

41
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,130
So how do we also load that data.

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:15,330
Let's head over to our series The HP and simply see any time you want to load this model make sure you

43
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,120
load this relationships.

44
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,980
So we want to load with the lessons relationship.

45
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,340
Yeah but we don't have this relationship yet right.

46
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,680
So let's go ahead and Queechy lessons return this mini lesson class.

47
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:35,670
Let's go ahead or index that bleed ph be for the series and actually try to co-opt something like service

48
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,110
lessons first title.

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,320
So let's see this in action refresh.

50
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:40,670
OK.

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,330
So there we go.

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,220
We are actually having access to that relationship.

53
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,080
But let's make sure this details actually autoload that by going to our series controller and using

54
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:56,070
a die dump series and quick refresh and check out the relations we have lessons collection right here.

55
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,620
Looks like that detail so that for us also.

56
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,620
Now what do we want to do when we have this page.

57
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:06,780
What I want to do is actually have a list of lessons but this list of lessons is going to be displayed

58
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,950
by huge s right here like maybe having the name and having us a Butson that opens a model to edit or

59
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,290
create a new lesson.

60
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,690
This is going to be controlled by Fujairah therefore we're going to have a component here that maybe

61
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,290
view lessons and then veejays is going to take it from here.

62
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,170
All the speech is going to do is pass the lessons into the veejays component.

63
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,350
So let's go ahead and start working on that in the next lesson.
