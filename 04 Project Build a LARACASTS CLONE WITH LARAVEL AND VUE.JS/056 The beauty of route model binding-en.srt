1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,890
Let's stop talking and actually viewing the speech where we can see a series and all the details for

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:05,820
that series.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,250
Now I want to change the redirect that happens or that we get when we create a series.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,730
So I'm just going to redirect two routes and this is going to be series that show and this is because

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,830
if we check out at least we discover that we have this it gets serious and serious.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,360
I don't have cable which maps to see the statue.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,030
OK.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,410
So suits that show and it's going to call this method.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:35,680
So for us let's just take them a serious find ID to create a series.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,570
We then we direct to this mid-thought.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,660
And sure enough we need to pass in a parameter so the barometer that we're going to be crossing is the

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,600
ID of the series that we just created.

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,180
OK so looks like we don't have access to that idea right here.

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,200
OK because we did everything in our request.

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,320
Yeah we could continue doing everything in our request so maybe we would want to return this and then

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,710
move this functionality into our request last.

17
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:09,590
So if we had a lot of create serious requests that where we were in the series we would want to do this.

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:16,980
So we set our session here and will save our series and then return direct routes to series ID.

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:24,440
So our controller Simplicius return request are glossaries to return requests of lawsuits On-Star series.

20
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,890
Then we just take care of flushing to the session.

21
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,970
Redirecting about right here.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,840
OK so once we get a serious redirect to this page and then we died on the Sui's detour Let's go ahead

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,730
and try this out.

24
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,910
So our new title series will be maybe view Jirus course Ruggiero's course description and then we could

25
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:50,670
upload an image for that creates serious and sure enough redirect to this page and we can actually see

26
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,000
the series data your id Software with their numbers and all of that.

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,630
But then one of the main reasons or one of the main purposes of this course is to use the best out of

28
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,400
love right.

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,480
So what I'm going to do is actually search out and use roud model binding in this case so far out modelled

30
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:08,980
by any.

31
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:16,230
We just need to type a series class right here and Labu automatically inject the series that has that

32
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,920
particular identification.

33
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,270
Right.

34
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,530
So we need to find a series.

35
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,290
We just need to date on the series and say we need to import the Swiss last and thats done so lovable

36
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,830
traumatically find the series with the ID that most passed this.

37
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,900
And then its going to die on that civies.

38
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,020
So lets stretch refresh passing in six right here.

39
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,830
And we see how exactly that at some level magic.

40
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,400
Now I dont want to have numbers in my bar.

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,800
I want to have the small.

42
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,760
Because we have a slot for Sui's right.

43
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,440
So what can we do in this case.

44
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:55,620
Now take each of my CV Kamado and you actually see that extends the database up.

45
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,130
So lets try to model the pitch be from Lavo.

46
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,370
So database an equivalent of a PH B and check out what we have.

47
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:12,050
We should have a get well Keenum thought so get outs key gets the value of the Modell's of our key and

48
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,850
get vault key name gets the key for the model.

49
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:21,440
So by default if you check out get key name it returns the primary key.

50
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,570
And this very key by default obviously as we know is the ID which is working now.

51
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,190
Therefore what do we need to do.

52
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,850
We just need to overwrite the get route key name thought ain't our motto.

53
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,990
So I'm just going to copy this head over to my sister PSP and paste this in.

54
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,490
So get mark key for the model and rather than we can indeed.

55
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,250
I'm going to return SLOC.

56
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:44,680
OK.

57
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,190
So I want you to use the slot to find the series.

58
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,660
Yeah but then if he says this now it's going to break right because we are passing in the ID and we

59
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,190
can and you find that right.

60
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,110
So I would head over to our series and right here rather than passing the ID we would parse the slot

61
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,660
because we know that's what level is which you use to find this model.

62
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,290
Let's go back refresh.

63
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,030
Create a new course.

64
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,330
So luggin costs a lot.

65
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:17,510
MH in at the top of that description Critch series and automatically we have that injector for us.

66
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:24,770
So see how we passed in the lock and levels still found that slot for us and injected into our show

67
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,430
method.

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,600
Pretty cool right.

69
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,180
Great job.
