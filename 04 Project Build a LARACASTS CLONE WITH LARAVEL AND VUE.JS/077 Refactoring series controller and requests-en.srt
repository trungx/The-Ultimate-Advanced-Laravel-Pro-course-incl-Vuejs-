1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,280
OK let's do a little bit of free FoxxHole.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,570
Like I said I'm not comfortable with having this duplicate method.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,730
It's not just cool.

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:10,120
OK.

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:17,510
So what I'm going to do is create a serious request and then the update service requests and the create

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,350
serious requests can inherits from this request.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,350
OK so I'll see what I mean.

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,700
Let me create a request.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:32,260
PH We sign make request and this is going to be serious request

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,630
OK.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,680
So you know a serious request.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,470
We have a blank credit right here.

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:46,580
But what happens is that if you want to make sure everything was in my test so that the Rifat saw stage

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:54,310
is when you actually make sure we didn't break anything like Saw the test run well no I would make sure

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,930
that there are these serious requests and the Christmas request inherit from this loss.

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,750
So I had a lot of dead serious request.

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,820
Now pulao this mid-thought cuts it out completely.

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,840
This seat my service request and pasted in.

19
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,670
OK.

20
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,940
So we have this mid-thought of the label.

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:20,440
Then in my obituaries requests are no longer winsby extending form requests from Larkhall but I'll be

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,400
extending series request so I know it is animal.

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,160
OK.

24
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:32,770
So our series of quest is not going to have an authorization Mithal because I want to take care of these

25
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:39,370
and the trout glossies and those are going to have Smith thought it's just going to have this method

26
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,130
that is common to both classes.

27
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:51,570
So which means in our quit serious requests we can also pre-loved this method completely and then it's

28
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:58,960
no longer going to extend for request but it's going to extend serious request not block this use.

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:06,020
And now everything should work as expected because this method now is common to both classes.

30
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,160
So let's run our tests again and see if we book anything.

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,400
Okay great.

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,640
We didn't break anything right.

33
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,710
But then we removed that to placation by also extending cost on request classes.

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,320
Now I'll have a watch through my series controller and I'll try to clean up these audio series.

35
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,980
So if Sourcefire we are overloading the series for a start let's just cut this out and just move it

36
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,060
into our service requests.

37
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,910
So I'm just going to call request of this series.

38
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,850
Okay then would I know what's in the update request.

39
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:49,320
Paste that then creates that mid-thought which was a serious case study.

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,250
So if request hausfrau will no longer be dealing with requests we'll be dealing with this.

41
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:02,930
So if this hausfrau updates us let's pause in the series into this method as a parameter or from our

42
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,640
current series

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:19,920
then this load suits you may get the file name and get this title get this description.

44
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,290
And finally also get this title then safe.

45
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,100
OK.

46
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,390
So right here we are data series plus the session with the user to the vault.

47
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,670
So if everything goes well we actually haven't broken anything and we can easily check that we are to

48
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,810
search.

49
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,380
Great.

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,230
We haven't broken anything but I think our controller looks cleaner when you come to our control or

51
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:52,020
you can we request updates serious and then you can visit Chris loss to see what series that is.

52
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,720
Great.

53
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,510
Great job.
