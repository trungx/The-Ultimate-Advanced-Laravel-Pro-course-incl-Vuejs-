1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,600
What I want to achieve in this video it's a way for us to quit lessons.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,900
Therefore I'm going to have a button here that when the user clicks on it it's going to pop up.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,060
And that creates a lesson.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,600
Now let's get straight into it right at the top.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,590
Why don't we will have an actual tech center and indeed we're going to embed a button that says Create

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,620
a new lesson.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,110
OK.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,540
So that looks great for me.

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,290
And we're going to eventually now which is going to simply call create new lesson my thought.

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,450
We need to create that math.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,770
So we'll have my thoughts property on that.

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,480
We're going to have to create new Laursen method.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,270
And now we have to think about how we want to create lessons.

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,090
This is a component that is going to be in charge of managing the lessons and they don't want to really

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,080
put in the functionality of quitting lessons right here.

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:45,630
OK.

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,760
What I want to do is actually create a chat component that is going to create lessons and it's actually

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,290
going to give us a great learning opportunity to see how to manage child components and parent communication

19
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,310
if you just components so let's go ahead and create that in the same directory.

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:07,250
I'm going to New up a new component and then I'm going to have children a tree created lesson that view.

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:07,890
There we go.

22
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,880
And this quick lesson that is going to be a child of the templates that we had before.

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,100
So we're just going to have an edge one that says Create lesson just for understanding purposes.

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:26,070
Squit export default empty object and we need to register these components either in our objects which

25
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,710
will already slide globally we view just instance or with our lessons that view which is simply going

26
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,940
to be just with this particular component which is actually a view in stone.

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,190
But it's going to be local only to this component so it's only available for some test component.

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,430
Therefore we have a component's property.

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,540
And what we you study is create a lesson and this is going to require from the directory to create a

30
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,990
lesson that you follow.

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,680
Now what we could do is actually meet an event this that Emmets events which you just provide to us

32
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:04,410
and the name of that event is going to be creating new lesson events and we could actually pass an optional

33
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:04,990
law.

34
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,980
But now we don't have any Pido So we're just emet you meet that event.

35
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,960
Therefore you know what component.

36
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,830
What we can do is have a mount up property and we're going to subscribe to the events coming from our

37
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,620
parent so we can see this that parents dot on Creedon your lesson events do something.

38
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,750
So right here we can actually receive any permits us to the past into this event but now we don't have

39
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,310
any so we're simply going to console that clock.

40
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,240
Hello parents.

41
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,680
We are creating the lesson OK.

42
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,460
We saved up.

43
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,800
Now what we need to do is actually mount this component somewhere right.

44
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,390
So for starters let's try to just mounted in the template for this component.

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,250
So create lesson and I think that's a good place to start.

46
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,810
Quick refresh and then let's click on that button.

47
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,740
Check out the console and right do we have help parents.

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,490
We actually in that lesson.

49
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,470
So it means a watch I can put any such Are you listening to events successfully from its parent.

50
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,760
OK.

51
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,640
So how do we want essentially to look.

52
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,580
I'm just going to head over to Doug component here I'm all beaches at the same place.

53
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,480
And I've got a copy or moved on from there to my Create lesson on page study.

54
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,210
And let's just change a little bit of defaults.

55
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,360
It's going to be create new lsen.

56
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,590
Nobody is going to have a couple of fun elements.

57
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,100
What we now need to do is actually trigger the opening of this model.

58
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:28,610
So I'm just going to change this idea to create lesson ID and we can actually use bootstrap with Jake

59
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,990
Querrey to open this so we can find that element using your course finder.

60
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,740
And the idea is create lesson and then we can call them with all my thought on this element because

61
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,270
it's a model.

62
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,620
OK so let's try this out.

63
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,120
Quick refresh check out the console click on that and we have this console the clock.

64
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,380
And then we also have our model open.

65
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:46,940
Great jump.

66
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,240
Let's start working on this in the next lesson.
