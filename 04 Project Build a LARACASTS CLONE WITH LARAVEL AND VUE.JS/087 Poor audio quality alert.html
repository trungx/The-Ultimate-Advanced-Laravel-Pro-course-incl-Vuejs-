So I suggest if you are using earpieces or headphones, you should do without them for the next three lessons, and after that everything will get back to normal. I am so sorry for any inconveniences, and I plan to re-record theses lessons in the future. </p><p>The audio hizzing sound is not that bad, so I think you could still watch with the sound, but you would have to bear it. Thanks a lot for understanding. Now back to coding :)<br></p></p>
