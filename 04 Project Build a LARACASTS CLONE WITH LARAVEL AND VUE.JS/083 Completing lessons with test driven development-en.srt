1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,410
Let's stop having some of your fun.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,010
So we've already talked about how we're going to be using this now.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,030
Well I want to do is create a couple of units that are going to help us drive all the functionality

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,070
that we want to have in our learning management system.

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,410
So we wanted a user to be able to complete a lesson.

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:24,800
We also want to use to be able to complete a series and we want to start a track record of the series

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,660
that the user has completed a number of lessons completed by the user and all of that.

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:35,260
So we're going to be using uniters because we want to test specific methods on the use of class that

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,940
stored the records of progress for our user.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,720
So I'll start by creating a unit test.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,470
Are sand makes us and our Codys use access on our specify that each unit.

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,960
So every single test I one to test the concerns the use of class we're going to put it in the issues

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,540
or tests.

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,370
OK.

15
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,040
So the first test I'm running is test.

16
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,560
A user can complete a lesson.

17
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,420
OK.

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,550
So what does this test really mean.

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,280
I want to have a user in my system and I want this use to click on the start series button which is

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,250
going to take him to the page where he can watch the episodes or lessons in this series.

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:24,770
And once he finishes to watch a lesson it should automatically save the ID of the lesson in the wretch's

22
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,350
database to tell us that this user has really watched this lesson.

23
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,790
OK so maybe we're going to have a key like use are.

24
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:38,330
And then passing they use us I.D. and then we're going to have series for that particular series I.D.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,350
and then we're going to map this to an array that stores the IDs of all the lessons that the user has

26
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,620
watched in this particular series.

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,370
OK.

28
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:56,180
So instead we would have you use are you create a new use or create a new series then would perform

29
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,430
an action and we might call a complete lesson.

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,320
My thought on I use.

31
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:11,630
And and finally we can make some assertions we can assert that our Ready's database has a key user with

32
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:18,950
the ID of the user then the ID of the series and then assert that he actually has an array that concerns

33
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,540
that contains the ID of that lesson that the user completa.

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,490
OK so let's try this out.

35
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,760
So my question I use I use are equal Sfar tree creates.

36
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,590
And we're going to specify that we want for the use of class.

37
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,320
So we'll create a series also and will specify a sou'west class.

38
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,330
And if we want to complete a lesson we need to also create a lesson.

39
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:55,900
So I would say lesson factory and I would see for the lesson class and would create and for testing

40
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,530
purposes.

41
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:02,870
Let's make sure that this lesson actually belongs to the series by overwriting the series ID field from

42
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:10,220
our factory and making sure that we put in our own ID which would be the suicide we just created right

43
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:10,720
here.

44
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,750
OK.

45
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:18,890
Then would call or use our complete lesson mid-thought and for us for our session would say this our

46
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:28,370
search equals Radice and would use as members because we want to see it in a set.

47
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,880
Remember we use in a sense because we don't want duplicate values.

48
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,890
It's just like a list but it's not going to allow us to store duplicate values into that list.

49
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,710
Or are we.

50
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,380
OK.

51
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:46,750
So we want to assert that when we call Ready's to get a key which is user and the idea of that user

52
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,310
actually one and the series idea should be one.

53
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:56,630
This exact key should march and array which has ID 1.

54
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,470
OK.

55
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:06,350
So when we complete lesson one it should create this key which is for the series that this lesson belongs

56
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:06,890
to.

57
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,450
And we fully specify that it belongs to series one because remember we're going to be using a fresh

58
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,390
database right.

59
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,620
So this use all the idea of one series idea of one lesson of one also.

60
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:23,150
And we're trying to make sure that this key will exist in our ready store and it would automatically

61
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,380
be equal to the radius ID of one.

62
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,620
OK.

63
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:36,410
Now before we want this test I'll do a little creek of imports one for broadcast used for the lesson

64
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,190
and the sooks.

65
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,720
OK.

66
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,370
Let's run these tests individually.

67
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,740
One hit.

68
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,630
We have a culture on the find mid-thought complete lesson.

69
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,630
So ahead of us who may use our class and our credit my thought

70
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,140
OK run again.

71
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,190
And then we can find this.

72
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:07,330
So my test and our use ready to proceed run again expected that we had nothing.

73
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,460
But after all we're supposed to be an array.

74
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,070
OK.

75
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,790
So we want to walk in our complete lesson method.

76
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,310
Now looks like we really need to know the particular lesson that we are completing.

77
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,870
So this my thought let's pass in the lesson that we have here.

78
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,560
OK.

79
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:29,990
So we're going to accept that lesson into this thought and what we want to do here is save this and

80
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,750
we'll see as that is the method we want to call.

81
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,430
So it's adding to a set and the set has to be of a particular pattern.

82
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,060
Right.

83
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,550
Remember we said we need to use our car loan they use our ID.

84
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:52,340
So we going to call this I.D. and then we need the Sui's I.D. So we will cause serious car loan and

85
00:05:52,340 --> 00:06:00,790
then we'll call the lesson I will get a serious relationship I will get the I.D. from there and the

86
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,770
value that we're going to be adding is the lesson ID.

87
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,570
OK.

88
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,240
Understand.

89
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,100
So for us to achieve this key we need the use of ID which is one right here.

90
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:18,980
We need a serious I.D. which is this one and then we need to put in the lesson I.D. which is this key

91
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,550
right here.

92
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:19,970
OK.

93
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:26,060
So we are actually building a unique key so that it would be unique for every Yousaf which takes a particular

94
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,920
series OK so let's run this test and see what we get.

95
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,170
Hope everything does not blow up.

96
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,090
OK.

97
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,350
But gas really is not fun.

98
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,020
We just need to import.

99
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,540
So use ready Swazey

100
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,490
one that again tried to get property of known object.

101
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,480
And I think that should be common because we don't have our relationship or lesson for lesson.

102
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,110
I'm serious.

103
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:53,520
OK.

104
00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:02,520
So what are the what are lessons lost I will create a relationship for that so return this belongs to

105
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,500
the series class.

106
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,360
OK.

107
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,900
So let's run that.

108
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,940
And we still get a failure.

109
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:16,650
So why don't we do this with headbutts or I use OUR And I'm gonna copy the stream right here and I'm

110
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:23,430
going to use a day dump just to know the result of that stream operation right there just to make sure

111
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,850
we are truly saving the correct string to the database right.

112
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,280
So let's run that test.

113
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,120
We have use our 12 series 13.

114
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:38,160
So we actually are not refreshing our database which means we are not getting fresh data.

115
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,130
So let's use Refresh database traits right here.

116
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:41,780
OK.

117
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,270
So this is what I do most of the time.

118
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:49,050
If I don't understand why something is happening it's just like unsoldered locking javascript.

119
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,720
You can write them anywhere you projec to see what's going on at that particular point.

120
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,650
OK so let's run this.

121
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,250
And great.

122
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,880
We have a successful test.

123
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,560
OK.

124
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,030
So that's how we can actually complete a series.

125
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:09,950
And then later in our project we can get the series or lessons that a particular user has completed

126
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,220
by getting this key.

127
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,100
OK.

128
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,740
So for now let's Rifat So this lieto we have a user.

129
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,800
We don't need to create a series right here.

130
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,520
We're not using the series variable.

131
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,760
What we're going to do is simply place it as such.

132
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,490
OK.

133
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:32,720
Because this lesson automatically is going to generate a new series and we can use that series here.

134
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,400
OK.

135
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,770
So this is necessary complete the lesson.

136
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:44,030
And I said that what the array that the Ready's as members mid-thought returns to us is exactly this.

137
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,760
OK.

138
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,230
One that says one more time.

139
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,300
Michel we've not broken anything.

140
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,730
Great Red Green.
