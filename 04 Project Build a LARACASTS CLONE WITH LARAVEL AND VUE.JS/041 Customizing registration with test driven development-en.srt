1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,480
Let's begin with our ministration.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,290
So first of all I'm going to go to my theme and I have the space register.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:13,110
Accion all I'm going to copy it at what's on my registar the late the PH We are going to pull everything

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,390
right there in space.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:21,360
Now I don't really have any problem actually duplicating this because it's seemingly complicated to

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,670
actually use exactly the same layout for now because we're going to have to use a bunch of your Stedman's

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,470
to actually check if this is the registration page because this is such a little thing doesn't really

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,130
matter.

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,250
I'm going to go ahead and do it this week.

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:34,790
OK.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,710
So we have just register page.

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,070
Richard Travis this the box and see what we have registar.

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,990
And we have this recession page with this beautiful background image and shake it off.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,620
We could actually use this registration page to copy or get the user's credentials.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,960
He's caught to subscribing to a planet.

16
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,110
But that's going to be needed.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,260
So for now let's focus on what we want.

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,600
We want to get to use this e-mail address and the password right so that we get the user name and then

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,450
we're going to automatically urging them to use US username behind the scenes which means we're still

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,290
going to write a little bit.

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,020
The default for Lovelle.

22
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,170
So first of all let's set up this form.

23
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,270
You walk like Lovelle expects it to.

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,260
So head will form.

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,110
Make sure that we have a CSR field.

26
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:25,440
We have our action attributes and issue a truly VC slush registar and the name of this should be name.

27
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,890
So this is actually going to be full name if that's what we want.

28
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,540
And for us treacly exactly what Lavallee suspecting from last letter are the words or just stuck on.

29
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,950
And we're going to check out of conditionals.

30
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:44,760
So loverly suspect in a name field an email which must be unique to the table and the password.

31
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,530
So we need to pass in the e-mail.

32
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:54,850
So a name for this field should be e-mail changes to type e-mail just voice unified validation crossword.

33
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:01,530
And I don't want to do a password confirmation so I'm going to make sure I placed the name because password

34
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,000
and just range Arista control.

35
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,320
Let's just go ahead and see how it walks.

36
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,370
First of all we make a request to register and point.

37
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,450
And let's actually check out what the default is called.

38
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,330
So we are Sun Rock at least and it looks like largely calling a registar method.

39
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,940
So let's go ahead to this class and we can't find any reached effort here so we should be in a trade.

40
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,820
And then we go.

41
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,720
So let's get over it soon.

42
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:32,320
This tread is so registar use OSS and should actually find a register method.

43
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,320
There we go.

44
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:41,910
So first of all calls and this validates or validates that and maybe returns Barkworth any of us for

45
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:48,260
us any ventures see to use or successfully we just start and actually embedded in that event.

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,380
It's actually going automatically creates the user.

47
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,500
So user this creates.

48
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,730
So this is it's actually creating the user.

49
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,790
So it's going to create mid-thought on our register control right down here on the bottom and then it

50
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,650
lsen the use of romantically and then calls this Williston method.

51
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,780
All if this were just a method it's not defined just like authenticated.

52
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,110
It's automatically going with redirects the user to redirect path.

53
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,290
And with Derek puffa methode comes from these we Daryn.

54
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,200
Suzanne.

55
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:18,640
OK.

56
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,900
So what are we going to be doing.

57
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,380
Let's just stop writing from our on.

58
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,690
And then we're going to move forward.

59
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:32,670
So like we said we don't want a password confirmation so we just need to move the confirmed validation.

60
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,140
That's the first thing.

61
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,000
And we just need a name with an e-mail with us and a password.

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,450
I think that validation is actually good enough.

63
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,710
So we just need to submit the correct data to a post and point.

64
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,110
OK.

65
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,410
So let's try this out.

66
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,730
Registar new use off I'm just going to try to register them for myself.

67
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,780
So seems like it was actually passing the correct data on.

68
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,380
Right.

69
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,420
So what are we going to do such really generate a new username for the user.

70
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,740
So I want my user to have a user name and the main reason why we're doing all of this is so that you

71
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:13,410
see how you can actually override the system and customize it to your needs.

72
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,220
OK so I want a user name for my field but I want automatically generated from the Forni.

73
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:26,690
So why would you still control to make sure that when I'm creating a user I also actually create a user

74
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:34,440
name field so username and automatically generate the username from the name.

75
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,030
So strange SLOC dates on name.

76
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,960
And obviously this is not really feel right because we don't yet have this field in our database so

77
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,370
why don't we actually drive this with a test.

78
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,940
So I'm just going to credit this out and I'm going to create a new test.

79
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,650
So we have to son make test registration test.

80
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,010
OK.

81
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:02,490
So you know a registration test and write a test run up public function it or use has a default user

82
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,260
name after registration.

83
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:09,570
So we actually tested this functionality because it's not provided to us by Lavoe by default.

84
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,570
And once Michel we had actually you know making an errors.

85
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,160
So how is this squinch look we're going to create a new user or actually make a post request to our

86
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,980
register controller and points and I said that the database actually has a use or with a particular

87
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:23,810
username.

88
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,190
Let's see how this is going to look.

89
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,590
This post to slash registar.

90
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,650
I mean it'll pass you know.

91
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:34,980
And we were getting passed in name is going to be my name and we're going to post in an email.

92
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,120
And we need to pass a password.

93
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,350
And at the end of that request that's just a search statues of 200.

94
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,480
And the assertion augment a session we won't so actually do is assert that the database has a particular

95
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:48,990
user.

96
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,630
So we're going to be finding in the use oste more on the really passing in is going to see find the

97
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:01,380
user using the username and we can pass in the streets location of my name because that's what we want

98
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:01,790
right.

99
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,590
So we are not passing in any username here but what we just Rhaetian we want to make sure that there

100
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,680
is a username field and there exists a user whose username is actually this username.

101
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,870
And I think that's going to make sure that the registration process takes care of this username.

102
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,110
OK so let's go ahead and try to run this.

103
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,060
So be in it for this coming up.

104
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:29,780
And sure enough it feels better since we received a tweet or two rather than 200 because you read a

105
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,170
letter or we just use the controller.

106
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,950
We actually are retreating to use us to this path.

107
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:41,960
If the registration is successful so follow assertions we really shouldn't be searching for 200 which

108
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,320
we are searching for three or two or we should actually Corda said redirect method.

109
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,430
So that's wrong.

110
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,270
And now we achieve half what we expect.

111
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,540
Right.

112
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,500
So it's study knows that filled assorting that you wrote in the table we use as much as to attribute

113
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,340
username is this.

114
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:58,830
Right.

115
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:05,450
So let's go ahead and start by actually making sure we yes a user name for the user on the fly.

116
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,430
So strange lock and he's going to taking data on me.

117
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,020
OK.

118
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:16,340
So we are actually passing the username and just so we don't have to go through the cycle of violence.

119
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:20,020
We know we need to actually provide this you know create these.

120
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,570
So let's go ahead and take care of that immediately.

121
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,640
So let's quickly use field table.

122
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:31,760
It's going to be a simple stream and I'm going to make that unique one last stop or use a factory.

123
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,900
We have to make sure the dosage and who eats the username on the fly.

124
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,010
So we don't have to figure.

125
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,440
So there should be strings long and you're taking names.

126
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:47,410
So what I can actually do is create a name to be able to be close to a fake name and we're going to

127
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,060
reference it here.

128
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,050
OK.

129
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,510
That's all it's asked.

130
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,690
That's one of the tests and see what we get.

131
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,610
Looks like we haven't ever chickened out and it seems that's giving us an Taguchi country in violation

132
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,920
because this username is actually not seeped into the database and that should be coming from our users

133
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,600
or the PSP which does not permit the Masao Simon exception.

134
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,440
So what we should do is show each other love will flock flat as an arrow.

135
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,220
OK.

136
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,310
Run that again.

137
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,720
And sure enough we are back.

138
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:23,260
GREENE So looks like everything successful with Telecom customization after registration.
