1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,560
Now let's do some clean up and finally test our system my own test.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:10,430
I want to include one assertion and that's the assertion to make sure that we have a session.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:17,930
So a set session costs success and this success should actually say your email has been confirmed.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,460
OK.

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,480
So let's work on that test and sure enough we don't have that session said.

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,720
But let's head over a confirmed email control and set up this session session.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:35,810
Flash success and the value for the key should be this string like your kids.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,130
So let's run that one more time.

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,880
And we're back to green.

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,760
OK so waiting we write a test for when things go wrong test or use all these redirector.

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,830
If so can be is wrong.

12
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:55,180
So we'll just do exactly the same thing create or use or make a request to that end point.

13
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:01,010
But this time on whether that person in the right tool can read just cannot pass in wrong token and

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,930
we're going to run some assertions so assert redirects to hold.

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:14,400
And we also assert session horse and error key and that he sees for mation.

16
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,540
So can mark.

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,520
We cognized.

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:16,990
OK.

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,130
So that's what happens when the talking is not correct.

20
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,860
Let's go ahead and one that says already and sure enough we have a feeling because we 22:00.

21
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,250
Now let's head over to our controller and then you know what else block is simply going to see session

22
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,900
flash Iraki.

23
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,230
And that message is going to be exactly what we have here.

24
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,380
Conformations who can not be customized and return redirects to the home page.

25
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,440
Arkie we have a successful test.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,560
Final step.

27
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,530
Let's go ahead and make sure or confirm your email Matsen.

28
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,500
I tried the leads to that approach.

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:53,930
Right.

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,350
So we can actually simply use avouch name that sees confirm email.

31
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,960
And then in a way that we we just need to give these routes a name right.

32
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,830
So name confirm email and we should be good to go.

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,360
So for us it is this.

34
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,080
Let's go ahead and tweak it sets r.p.m. drop us.

35
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:16,900
That's a track to receive our emails copied and used only right here in my anyhow.

36
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,540
I'm going to be studying the mail truck usernames is going to be here.

37
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,380
Copy the password and I'm going to put it here.

38
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,200
OK so that's basically all I need to send e-mails.

39
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:33,810
And now if I tried this out in the Masayoshi that it truly truly got via e-mails I think I left out

40
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,820
something and that's in our template we need to actually pass in the token Trudy's you know what we

41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:46,230
could do here is just concatenate this to where a token equals and still concatenate these to use or

42
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,380
confirm token.

43
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,270
So we actually in of Heartbeat token to that Motson for us to actually have access to the user.

44
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,830
We need to head the virtual Me level and actually receive it right because the properties that are existent

45
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,810
on these Magdalens simply are the public properties of this class.

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,400
Therefore we need to set up a public use our property and we see it in here.

47
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:15,200
So use and this user because user I'm just going to be generic right here.

48
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:19,020
But of course you can take into to make sure you've not seen any subtle beats.

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,270
Then we need to go to whoever is sending this mail which is in all registar control.

50
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,400
You know we just stopped mid-thought and we need to pass in the user.

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,020
OK.

52
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,850
So confirm your email and will post in the news.

53
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,590
So we have access to that user who will confirm your email the bleep that it should be.

54
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,600
OK.

55
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,160
So let's make this walk or visit maybe just about rigid state test.

56
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,820
And that takes the whole means no loss.

57
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:51,030
Let's check out that Chanoff we have an e-mail to test our test at converso but cost one more step before

58
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,550
joining us from your e-mail.

59
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,750
And right now we discovered that this e-mail actually is Fosi need to talk and right.

60
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,070
So let's click on it takes us to that end point.

61
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,980
And he says an error.

62
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,060
I commenced to function this.

63
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,720
OK.

64
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:12,360
So this is simply because remember we switched out this route just to test out confirm your e-mail functionality.

65
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:12,780
OK.

66
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,840
But everything's OK.

67
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,420
Perfect.

68
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,120
OK.

69
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,190
So when you clicked on from your e-mail you got to really get that done.

70
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:28,360
Now let's just check out our database to make sure that the news is confirmed so our users get on off.

71
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:34,110
And so it's not options but cost run that and we see the conference or can you not.

72
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,720
So it means we have one confirmed use in our system.
