1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,670
OK let's officially quit the speech.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,130
How do we want this to function.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,810
We want somebody who doesn't own the profile or will be able to see it.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,180
OK.

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,810
For example you can see other users are therefore we have to maybe pass some way to identify the user.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,710
You are out.

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,360
So we're going to be using the SLOC field for the user which saved us a username in our users table.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,720
So let's just go ahead and set up a route in our web that it would be the profile and we can create

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:35,660
a profile on the Arts Index and we want this far out to actually accept a parameter.

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:42,400
OK so I'm going to call this varments I use art because I want to use Lovell's Rob model by name and.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,930
And I need to create this Consolo saw created here.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,850
Our son may control the first controller in our control.

13
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,930
We need an index and I thought and we are requesting that level automatically injects to use our swords

14
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,660
to use but curses are here.

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,530
And if love will just automatically inject the user.

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:14,130
It's going to try to inject the user by the ID of the user but then he wants Lavo to use their use on

17
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,720
the field on this class.

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,950
So we are told Lavoe get Keenum and would return use our name.

19
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,810
OK so lovingly squit you try to find the user are using the User Name column in the database.

20
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:29,580
OK.

21
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:40,410
So for now let's just return a view and would also pass in refusal which is the use of the record from

22
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,980
the wrong model binding.

23
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,200
OK so we know my username.

24
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,290
Let's just copy that and try to get this right.

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:58,950
We have a form for me to call up our database we can go and we'll just get all the users but CAS use

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,790
all and the user name is cutie.

27
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,880
OK great.

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,960
So we should actually pull that out fresh.

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,610
There we go.

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,550
We have to use a speech right there.

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,480
So what do we want to do we want to air quotes the number of completed lessons on the series being watched.

32
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,460
OK.

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:26,060
So I over to the profile view and right here the number of lessons is going to be user get.

34
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:34,230
So total number of lessons completed which is the methodology actually created in the last video OK.

35
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,250
So it's actually get total number of complete adolescence.

36
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,870
So we're going to replace that.

37
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,280
And that's what we have then for the series being watch.

38
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,200
Let's just make sure we haven't this one.

39
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:51,780
So we have to rewrite now because the series that we have in our database right now we actually completed

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,710
all of them in our watch beach.

41
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,330
OK.

42
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:02,590
So three lessons completed and series being watched what we can do is pass new series from our control.

43
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,420
So I'm going to get serious right here.

44
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,840
So with a series and it be user.

45
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,920
Get serious.

46
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:11,860
OK.

47
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,340
And this method is also coming from right here because we test that and we know it's working.

48
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,030
OK.

49
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:25,830
So therefore in our profile the blade ph B where we have been watched we can just Cluj or Welkom the

50
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:33,900
lead the PH P and recopied is the exact same four hours loop and in our profile we just be studying

51
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,840
for now safe refresh trends to get property of an object.

52
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:48,830
OK let's go to our recopied to see what we have we have for each series which we passed in the title

53
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,030
description or read more.

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,980
So where could the Arrow be coming from.

55
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,340
So when we died or in our control to see what we actually have.

56
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,990
So we use our series being watched or just died and fresh.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,550
So we have an array.

58
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,920
And one of the elements is such Really.

59
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,910
That's why we're having some errors.

60
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,900
So this is not much of a big deal.

61
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,800
I think it's because we have a really messy database so values here and there and we actually don't

62
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,770
have the appropriate Ready's connection because we've been testing Whitted and we're using it now in

63
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,310
our view.

64
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:33,610
So that's why it took confusions but then for us to protect ourselves we can head over to what learning

65
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:40,710
that BHB and right here when we are mapping which we can fuel to eat to make sure that all know values

66
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,820
are rejected.

67
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,920
And we do that basically calling the full time method.

68
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,790
So the collection is going to move on and force values.

69
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,300
So let's refresh an artichoke or date them and now we have just one element in the tree which is the

70
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,790
one that was successfully found in the database.

71
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,260
OK.

72
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,180
So that should fix that.

73
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,920
Oh controller that died that we have refresh OK we're back.

74
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,190
So we have a list of series being watched by the user.

75
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,200
And then we have a list of lessons that the user has completed.

76
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,920
Now something I'd like us to talk about is how we want things to happen if the user is authenticated

77
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,470
or not and effectually locked out.

78
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,600
Right now I believe we're going to have a lot of errors everywhere because we've not been thinking about

79
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:27,900
that.

80
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,430
But we'll take that into very next video.
