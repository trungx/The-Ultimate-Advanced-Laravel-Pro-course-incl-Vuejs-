1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:07,050
In the last couple of lessons who creates a next and previous lessons math thought and then we also

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:15,520
quit a get or lessons method so we can get next boobish can also get all the lessons so let's go ahead

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:23,080
and use them on this page or head over to my watch that played the PH B and B can now have some buttons.

4
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,610
Awesome 8 arcs.

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:34,150
So I'll just give aid and box on the bottom in full and this is going to link to a page where we can

6
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,330
watch the next lesson.

7
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,880
So I'm going to see next lesson right here.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,730
OK.

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:50,380
And we are also going to have a button that button in full and this is also going to link to where we

10
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,660
can watch the previous lesson.

11
00:00:52,690 --> 00:01:00,290
So remember we can actually get the next lesson and previous lesson and also put the titles like here.

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:00,780
OK.

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,830
But we're not going to worry much about that.

14
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,360
Now let's have a watch on whether be.

15
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:13,490
And we have this watch Sui's show less and more thought and the name a series that watch which is expected

16
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,940
in the series and accepts in the lesson.

17
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:24,850
Therefore we can use that right here so we can see how it's a serious watch and would pass in the series

18
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,110
which should be lesson series snark.

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,260
Oh I think we actually passed a series from the controller must check the watch was controller.

20
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,560
And we actually passing passing the series and this is really going to help us.

21
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:46,320
So we don't have to make this query right here so we'll just have serious should be serious SLOC.

22
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:55,100
And the lesson should be lesson get the next lesson and get the idea.

23
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:01,690
Right now we only want to display these Matsen if we actually have a next lesson.

24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,570
Right.

25
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,280
So I would say if lesson get next lesson.

26
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,410
And if they're all based in the method.

27
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,160
OK.

28
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:18,850
So if we have a good next lesson then place make sure you displayed the link so that user can view the

29
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,800
next lesson.

30
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:25,720
So we have like let's get next lesson that we pass the ID and the squinch automatically take us to the

31
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,330
same page but we can watch the next lesson.

32
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,420
So we're going to do exactly the same thing for the previous lesson.

33
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:40,000
So just copy this and paste it right here and read it and get next lesson we'll use GET previous lesson.

34
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:48,890
And this would point to get previous lesson would see previous lesson and I think it's all set to try

35
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,200
this out.

36
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:58,100
So at the moment let's visit that page refresh and there's aspects that we don't have in the next and

37
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,830
few years because we don't have any other lessons for the series.

38
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:09,830
So it's on my service visit this one and I'm going to add a new lesson the lessons Aitu is going to

39
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,310
be what this course called Vohs the lesson VDU idea.

40
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,380
I'm going to get from V.M. any one on video.

41
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,200
The EPS number would be 200.

42
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:30,940
Because I want this to be done next and the description of course description something like that.

43
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,650
OK.

44
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,030
Then on Vimeo that's just fine.

45
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,160
We do.

46
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,630
And looks like an embed.

47
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,000
It's all just copied I.D. basic right there.

48
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,640
And great.

49
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,490
We have a new lesson.

50
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:48,410
So I just quick lesson so that we can actually see this in action.

51
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,320
And I'm just going to get another video and then I'm going to paste it in right there on the screen

52
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,830
TV be view out or introduction or whatever.

53
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,680
And this is going to be a piece at 300.

54
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,610
And he's going to be using Virata are in your applications.

55
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,350
OK.

56
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,970
So create lesson and we have that creature for us.

57
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:20,760
Now let's reset our visit our course consignor learning and we have our next lesson button right because

58
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,510
this is the first lesson if you click on this it takes us to lessons you and we have our next and previous

59
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,850
lesson buttons.

60
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,640
OK.

61
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,290
Because this is the second lesson.

62
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,920
But if you go to the next lesson we have only the previous lesson button because we are on Lesson three

63
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:45,320
and we can go to the previous and using this button and we can go to the previous and it works as expected.

64
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:45,930
OK.

65
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,760
And notice that once we actually visit those lessons we have the correct video monitored.

66
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,300
OK.

67
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,150
So if I this next lesson we have automatically the video that we just embedded.

68
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:57,620
OK.

69
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,050
So looks like everything is working great.

70
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,960
See the very next episode.
