1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:04,430
Let's get moving as you can see I completely changed the template that we're going to be using.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:08,370
We're going to be using the default level templates because I think we could do better.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,110
So what we're going to be doing is using a theme called the SAS.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,000
And you can find it on theme for no affiliates or anything but I've used the template I bought and used

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,630
it and I think it's really awesome.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,630
Very lightweight.

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,310
So if you want to use it in any production applications make sure you get the license.

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,700
But if not you could just use my copy for development purposes.

9
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,030
What I did was just to create an app that bleed that page and putting the theme.

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,630
Just install three simple siestas for hours and try off in the cold for these lesing you'd actually

11
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,520
have this theme food that contains all the files that you need for the theme.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,210
So I just took that in have a ZF of idea of app for viewers navigation right here home plug in.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,850
Dan I have a used header and used content then I have my work on the blade.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,170
That simply extends that lay out your header and then use the content.

15
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,350
Very simple stuff.

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,130
I don't want to bore you with all of this because that has little or no real learning in it.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,500
OK so what do we want.

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,450
We want to click on this loggin button and actually see a luggin form.

19
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:13,940
Right.

20
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,650
And then if we successful logging the page simply refreshes just like Jeffrey does it.

21
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,470
So let's go ahead and dive straight into it.

22
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,310
Now in the duck component of the Stillmore you can actually see this component which is a model and

23
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,930
I'm just going to go ahead and use it.

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,590
So I'll head over to my dock components and we have this model.

25
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,690
I'm going to copy it and then had to run my example to you which is the default lawn that comes with

26
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,970
Lavoe paste in that template.

27
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,720
And sure enough I you to rename that.

28
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,530
I'm going to rename that to plugging the view head over to my iPod.

29
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,110
Abda just so I can change how that is when you start.

30
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,680
So I need to change this to luggin the view and I'm going to change this to view plug in.

31
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,960
This is a component we can use in our view.

32
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,270
You can also see I have Flavell makes already running as a watcher.

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,090
OK so now that they have that the first thing was to put in that same plate.

34
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,980
I've done that.

35
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,540
But this template is going to be a model and it has to be triggered so I'm just going to change this

36
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,140
to logging mode on.

37
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,850
Which is going to be the I.D. I'm going to have to watch my Abda blade.

38
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,540
And one of the navigation components on navigation is there were still luggin so I'm going to make sure

39
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,920
these dates are Togo equals Modahl.

40
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:28,350
This is simply put structure and data are Touggourt is sequel to the lemon with IGY logging on.

41
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,290
So when you click on this it's going to trigger the mood on with this ID.

42
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,030
So now we need to actually Mullins This component in our view.

43
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,880
Therefore in my obdurately ph we just write down some way after all the fruits are on the for the future.

44
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,300
I'm just going to mount you luggin and that will make this template available in our view.

45
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:47,720
OK.

46
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:54,630
So nothing complicated we just start a new components and it's a more dump and contains the template

47
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:01,020
for that with all we have a link in our layout file which is the luggin and this simply triggers that

48
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,740
and we don't.

49
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,750
And we have we just start that component as villagey.

50
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,900
Therefore in our template We've mounted it as you logging right here.

51
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:10,670
OK.

52
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,090
So let's go ahead and see how this works.

53
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,040
A quick refresh.

54
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,180
And when I click on that.

55
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,240
Sure enough I see my model.

56
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,770
So let's go ahead and do a little edits to that model.

57
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,490
And what I'm going to do is actually simply paste in a luggin registar template right here just so why

58
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:30,130
don't waste your time trying to design stuff that will not even help us in this lesson.

59
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:30,730
All right.

60
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,550
Done.

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,290
So let's check out what we have now.

62
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,800
We simply have this loggin form and this is exactly the log in form from the template I just copied

63
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,800
and socket straight into the model dialog.

64
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,400
Dave So what do we want to happen.

65
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,820
We want the user to fill in his details into this form.

66
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,640
He does select remember me or not and then click on the login button.

67
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,680
Let's take care of that in the next video.
