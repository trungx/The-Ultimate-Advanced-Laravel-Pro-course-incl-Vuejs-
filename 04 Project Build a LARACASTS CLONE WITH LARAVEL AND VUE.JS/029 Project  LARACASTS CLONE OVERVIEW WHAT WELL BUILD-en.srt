1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,880
OK guys let's talk about aggregation we're going to be Buellton and we're going to build this from scratch

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,790
with a test driven development that poured right into us for everything.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,110
And it's going to be real fun.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,830
So if you want a true introduction yourself it leaves an immediate bad cast that come.

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,960
OK so what's this application.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,470
It's a SAS application.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,830
Like when you actually have in real life and it has courses and these courses are video lessons that

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,150
the subscribers on the platform can use.

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,250
Some of them are free.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,480
Some of them are not.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,460
And for the ones that are not free to use actually has to have a subscription which means you're going

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,830
to have a lot of cache and stripe in this project.

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,850
And this is going to create a subscription for the user giving him permission to watch any sort of lesson

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,170
on the proper form.

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:45,590
OK.

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,480
So if you go ahead and visit one of the courses right here which is actually created set by one of the

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,510
students here and this costs you can actually see that we have fortunately right here that detects if

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,030
you stay locked in use or has already started this course and they use and readies for that and we're

19
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,860
going to also write tests for that.

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:13,940
And if we continue learning right here then it kicks us to the page where we have the title of the series.

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,460
And we also have the title of the lesson.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,180
OK.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,420
And we actually have the play right here which loads videos for this but plan a lesson from the meal

24
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,870
and then we also have next and previous lesson Bateson's and notice how it redirected us to the second

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,150
lesson because this is where we left off the last time we started the series.

26
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:35,650
OK.

27
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,470
So we also have tracking right here with Reddy's.

28
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,840
We also have next lesson the previous lesson for Chanology right here.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,300
Go to the next one.

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,130
We also have complete lessons functionality.

31
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:56,680
So for example if I forward this video today and right here automatically you see right here it fires

32
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:02,740
up on events that tells us hey you completed the series but then if not the last lesson of the series

33
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,230
then it's going to redirect us to the next automatically.

34
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:06,840
OK.

35
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,710
Another functionals I want to show you is to create Sui's functionality where you can literally create

36
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,260
your own series as an administrator.

37
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,130
So if you have an administrator account you can create your own series upload images.

38
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,920
I'm going to be teaching you how to upload images to storage and how to test these laws to make sure

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,020
everything is fine and we are also going to be able to edit and deletes erase all of the functionality

40
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,000
and right here if we check out all the see.

41
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,680
This is for the users that are not administrators.

42
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,880
They can see other series.

43
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,750
But as administrator we can also visit all the service right here and we can see all the crates that

44
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:48,260
series if I click into this one then it takes us to the content area where we manage this series.

45
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:48,740
OK.

46
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,650
So we have this functionality right here and this dashboard is completely created in view G-S.

47
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,930
OK so if we want to delete this last one right here we can go ahead and delete right there.

48
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:07,540
And it gives us an alert and if we say OK then we have lessons with that successfully and we can actually

49
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,780
go ahead and create another son in case we want and this is simply going to add another lesson to the

50
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,530
dashboard.

51
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,320
We can also choose if a lesson is going to be premium.

52
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,700
And by default it's false.

53
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,820
But we want it to be true then means only subscribers will be able to watch that lesson.

54
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,340
OK.

55
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,100
So that's unfortunately we have quit with our day to day view.

56
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,280
Yes this is the most part where we're going to be using VHS and it's going to be real fun because that's

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,920
a lot going on right here.

58
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,360
Craig added late updates communicate with Sarratt and stuff like that.

59
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,160
So I'm just going to edit this lesson and I'm going to make it premium right here.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,820
OK.

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,850
So if I saved this lesson then I visit the home page visit that particular course and then continue

62
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,810
learning.

63
00:03:53,020 --> 00:04:00,700
I can actually watch it because I have an active subscription because if I visit my profile then check

64
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,410
out my payments on subscription.

65
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,870
You can see that my current plan is yearly right here.

66
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,490
OK.

67
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,720
And that can actually change my plan so we have change plan for you right here.

68
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,820
And if I want to change my card details I can also do that so I can update cards Ito's which parcel

69
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,950
this pretty Strype subscription form I can put in my details.

70
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,330
Basically every single thing you want to do in a stripe sarce live application.

71
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,280
We have that functionality right here.

72
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,830
OK.

73
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,690
So I'm not going to be showing you to everything because there is a lot but that's the basic idea of

74
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,550
the application.

75
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,980
And this actually has a lot going on behind the scenes tracking stuff with Reddy's making sure that

76
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,740
we write tests for everything so that everything once successfully hosting this application and deploying

77
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,410
it live.

78
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,680
It's going to actually take a lot of work and I'm going to be walking you to each and every one of that.

79
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,290
OK.

80
00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:02,020
So thank you so much and I hope to see you in the course where we actually start building this awesome

81
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,010
stuff.

82
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,730
Thank you.

83
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,700
And see you then.
