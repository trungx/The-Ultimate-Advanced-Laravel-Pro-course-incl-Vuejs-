1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,010
OK guys welcome back.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:08,560
This is where we left off in our projects and we are able to VCDs of course and be able to check if

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,200
to use ice cream.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,970
Now what I want to focus on is actually when we redirect the user when he clicks on this button.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,250
So remember if these users really started this series then we are going to see a continual learning

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,950
Butson the user has started this ritual.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,250
When you see a startling Motson like we see right now remember this new reason we created.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:36,240
So before we jumped into that I'm going to go to my lesson test and I did my test a little right here

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,310
that says that 6 sense can get next and lessons from a lesson.

10
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,740
One we to do is when this is such that the next lesson and previous lesson method should actually never

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,000
give us no.

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,580
So does it always give us a lesson.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,360
So in case we are trying to get the next lesson for the last lesson in that series it should just give

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,580
us the lesson and this we are trying to get the lesson for the first lesson in that series.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,090
It should also just give us that same lesson.

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,430
So how are they going to edit my assertions.

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:13,750
Right here in a certain or answer or more but I'm going to change this to a certain equals and lesson

18
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,120
to right here just to get you to ease naturally the first series.

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,660
The first lesson in that is lesson one is the second and this is the last.

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,230
Therefore get previous lessons.

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,560
Really was more like it was doing but nobody which updated by saying listen to which is this first.

22
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:36,580
When we tried to get when we tried to get the previous lesson you should actually give us a lesson too.

23
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,320
I'm going to show you what way I'm doing this right here.

24
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:39,990
OK.

25
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,610
So the same thing for the next.

26
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,130
So we're going to see it equals lesson.

27
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,980
We will get the I.D. and then we'll get Lesson 3 and get the idea.

28
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:50,630
OK.

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:58,840
So if one does test right now it's going to feel so good to be in the field so to this test and he try

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:06,000
to get property of object because obviously it's not so much a one lesson the PH be forced to actually

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
check if this isn't all we're simply going to see available.

32
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:17,850
So the next lesson equals this and right here what we'll do is simply have a check if next lesson return

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,940
next lesson.

34
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,610
OK.

35
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,210
But if that checks feels then we turn this OK.

36
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,810
So if there's no next lesson then simply return the correct lesson then we're to go exactly the same

37
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,090
thing like your previous lesson so previous lesson in all this.

38
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:43,020
And if we have a previous lesson which means it's not all fault you value will return.

39
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:51,210
Previous lesson OK else would simply return this which means this lesson.

40
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,650
That's more access.

41
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,550
And now we're back going now why am I doing this.

42
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:02,450
If we had the virtue of 30 that we we have some methods that are dependent on the next lesson.

43
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,260
OK.

44
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,030
For example this get the next lesson.

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,820
Watch.

46
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,280
Remember if we're trying to get the next lessons what a loser really completed that series.

47
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:17,430
We don't want our website to break and say OK we can find this lesson or we can get a bunch of them

48
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,190
all but we really wanted to give us the last lesson of that series.

49
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:21,900
OK.

50
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,910
So that said now how do we use this method.

51
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,200
Remember we agreed if we had to watch or watch series.

52
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,190
All right.

53
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,810
We're not index mid-thought when you use at least watch a series.

54
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,060
He certainly didn't make that to the first lesson of that Suze.

55
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,100
But we do want that.

56
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,630
We want to check if the user has started the series.

57
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,700
And if the user has started the series will redirect him to the next lesson that he has to watch.

58
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,130
For example even if he's watched less than one and listen to the lecture he should be watching this

59
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,780
lesson.

60
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,480
OK.

61
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,970
Therefore we'll just see if the authenticated user right here.

62
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:02,940
And what we're going to do is check if you are hostile to series or puzzling to see us then we're going

63
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,840
to redirect the user somewhere else.

64
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,540
And when we directly use our Mott's dyslexic which is the first lesson but we are going to get used

65
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,960
and the name of the method we can get it from are learning to be which is getting a license watch and

66
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,500
back.

67
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,230
Enjoy or watch SHOWBIZ on call or see next lesson watch on passing the series.

68
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:26,870
OK.

69
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,570
So the USALS really started the series will redirect the user to this lesson.

70
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,490
Alice is going to read the letter the first lesson.

71
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,130
OK.

72
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,230
So let's go ahead and check if this is working.

73
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,230
So refresh.

74
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,500
And by the way let me share my view right here.

75
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:49,430
So we have our series The beat the beat and right here we have a continual learning check.

76
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,640
I start learning.

77
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,660
So these are start at the series.

78
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,310
We have continual learning and neither has or has not yet started.

79
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,780
We have stopped learning.

80
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,110
So we are locked in.

81
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,710
That's why we see the Lenny freckly can start learning it redirects me to the first lesson.

82
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,780
So you see the currents in this and now is the first lesson.

83
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,420
I'm going to do is complete the series by simply playing that video.

84
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,190
And now it's at the end.

85
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,410
We're going to click OK you direct me to the second one but now I want to head back to that series and

86
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,940
we have Cancian you're learning.

87
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:27,160
But now click on this and you see that automatically redirects me to Lesson 2 and that I think my friend.

88
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,040
It's really really PERFEITO.

89
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,400
OK.

90
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,860
You don't always go and select the next lesson that you stopped the next time you log into our website.

91
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,530
OK.

92
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,340
So I think that's very convenient.

93
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,340
Let's just go ahead and complete this one for fun.

94
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:40,950
OK.

95
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,620
We've completed this series then the next one is this entry we haven't wasted.

96
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:52,020
Let's head back to that series and then we can continue learning automatically we are redirected to

97
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,110
the last lesson of the series because we've completed this one and this is all we have to watch next.

98
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,680
OK.

99
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,620
So great.

100
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,670
I think this works perfectly just like we expected to.
