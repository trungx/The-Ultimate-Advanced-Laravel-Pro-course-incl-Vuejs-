1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,300
I want to automatically update that as soon as we receive a response from our server.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,240
Therefore what we are going to be doing is meeting on events to the parents just like we did when we

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,260
were creating the lesson and our parents will automatically take care of the rest.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:24,360
So before we do that let's close this model and immediate events the name of this event is going to

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,150
be lesson updated on the pillow that we're going to be sending to our parents.

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:38,490
The screen should be response to data then in our lessons that view which is the parents we can listen

7
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:46,350
to that event by subscribing to it and we can receive the payload in here in a verbal lesson.

8
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,250
And when we received this we want to find that lesson using its I.D. in this lessons are eight.

9
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,200
And then we to automatically replace it with this response that we got from the server.

10
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,410
So let's get the next and we'll be searching the lessons.

11
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:10,470
Ari on this parents will be using javascript's fine index method and if you don't know about this method

12
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,900
this is a simple method that Joske provide to us and what is going to do is it takes in a closed shop

13
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,050
and it's going to try to find an element in the current rate that matches the condition that is placed

14
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,890
in that closure.

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,040
And if he doesn't find any then he's going to return negative one.

16
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,090
But if he finds he's going to return to the index of that element.

17
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:36,370
So would look to all of them and we have the current object in that array in this variable area.

18
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,040
So return less than that ID equals all that ID.

19
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,120
So we are looking for a lesson where the IDs match.

20
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:44,790
OK.

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,340
Now if you get that index what are going to do is we're going to replace this lesson with the one that

22
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:57,650
we have in the lessons are we this that license dot splice and the splice method.

23
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:03,930
Checking the index the number of elements we want to move and what replaced at that position.

24
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,690
So the lesson OK that should do the trick.

25
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,780
Let's go ahead and see how this works in our Vasa.

26
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,960
And we simply cannot do said at the end of the title so we know it's actually added that safe lesson.

27
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,580
It's closed.

28
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,650
And there we go.

29
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,830
We have just that right there.

30
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,790
So it means it's correct defined in that lesson and replacing it.

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,640
Now just for a tip if you're trying to update your lesson by simply saying that lessons and parsing

32
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,600
in the lesson index and replacing it with the lesson.

33
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,530
This is not going to work very well.

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,660
Yes.

35
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,430
And the recommended way to do that is using the splice method.

36
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,150
OK.

37
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,670
So that's a little gotcha that you might be struggling with but that doesn't work out here.

38
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,110
Yes.

39
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,810
Now let us notice something when we click on the new lesson Butson Yeah we still have these dates are

40
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,090
in our model and we actually have a safe lesson watching here rather than the button we specified in

41
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:57,710
our code.

42
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,280
So let's handle that.

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,220
The reason is we are not telling the model that we are resetting editing to false.

44
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,410
Therefore what we're going to do when we listen to that lesson we're going to set this that editing

45
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,550
to false and we have to clear this data.

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,820
So I don't want to go through the cycle of this that scription equals empty string.

47
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,110
Let's start with your idea those days.

48
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,470
Therefore I'm going to take this as an opportunity to simply refactor this into a class.

49
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,080
OK.

50
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,080
So what I'm going to be doing is defining a lesson class and this lesson class is going to take in a

51
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,550
lesson and it's going to set properties on this class that match that lesson.

52
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:46,050
For example this title equals lesson the title and if no less than the title exists we are going to

53
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,080
assign it to an empty string.

54
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,730
Say that description.

55
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,140
Cost less than the description or empty string.

56
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:01,020
This dog Id cause less than the video ID or an empty string.

57
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:09,310
And finally this is of course lesson that of number or an empty string.

58
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,140
And that's a simple lesson class that will help us refactor our code.

59
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,510
Now how do I want to use this when I listen to a Creedon you less than event.

60
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,480
I'm going to set this.

61
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,870
That lesson equals new lesson.

62
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:23,800
OK.

63
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,990
And it means I need a lesson property or this class.

64
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:33,130
And lesson for potty is all of this title description episode and video ID.

65
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,120
Therefore I'm going to replace all of this lesson.

66
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,080
OK.

67
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:42,020
So when we listen to quit new this that lesson is going to be a new lesson.

68
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,670
Therefore it's going to be empty.

69
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,980
And we should actually pass on empty object right there.

70
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,530
OK.

71
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:52,130
So it's going to be empty with all of these empty strings then right here where I have title description

72
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,200
video ID.

73
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,980
I'm going to replace all of this with this.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,040
That lesson equals new lesson and would pass in the lesson into the constructor.

75
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,670
OK.

76
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,840
And they also need to move the episode ID them with the series ID and lets them ID on this class.

77
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,090
Also when we are making a post request to quit a lesson we can now move all of this and pass in that

78
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,930
lesson.

79
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:25,610
And also when we are making that pooch request you can now replace all of this with this dog lesson.

80
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,850
OK so the only way to know if we've actually broken anything is to try it out right.

81
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,430
So let's go ahead and try.

82
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,980
Yeah.

83
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:39,220
And looks like we already have a bunch of Aristotle defined on that in science and that would be because

84
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:47,470
we have the model tied to the model vidual ID and all of that so we want to replace the lesson title

85
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:55,630
lesson that video ID lesson that episode number and finally lesson that description safe dog refresh

86
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,450
again and that clears up.

87
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,440
Let's check out of your tools and we have an empty lesson object right here right.

88
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,420
So let's click on average it populates that object with the data.

89
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,070
Let's get a lesson by adding a detat right here.

90
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,230
And reducing the description safe lesson and look at that nothing was broken.

91
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:24,410
So we actually had a successful refracts or not we were going to create new lesson Butson everything

92
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,950
is initialised back to an empty string.

93
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,000
So I think that actually works strangely perfectly.

94
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,830
Let's go ahead and create a lesson to make sure nothing is broken.

95
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,900
Great lesson.

96
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,330
OK.

97
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,080
So there we go.

98
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:45,800
We have a lesson here on the edge and we have the data and if you also hit on the Edit button it automatically

99
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,330
is parsed awesome.

100
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,830
So that looks like it's working perfectly.

101
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,320
I'm going to hit pause for a second and we're going to continue in the very next video.
