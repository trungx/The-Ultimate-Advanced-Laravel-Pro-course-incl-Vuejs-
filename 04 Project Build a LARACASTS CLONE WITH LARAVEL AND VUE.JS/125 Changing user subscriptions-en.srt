1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,610
OK next step once you get the possibility of the use or to actually change his plan.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,170
Yeah it's going to be really crappy if the user cannot wait for monthly plans.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,120
The yearly plan done great if it's not interested.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:12,660
OK.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,060
So that's what we're going to be taking care of in this lesson.

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,660
And as usual caution makes this a real priest.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,520
OK so for this lesson I behind the scenes prepared this form and this form is simply a soulmates which

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,860
is our select right here and we can either select the monthly or the yearly plan and we just click on

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,010
change plan and then we are going to send it our controller.

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,710
So for now it doesn't do anything we can empower it to actually communicate with the controller.

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,340
OK.

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,220
So we can look at the user ask Koreans Blunt let me take you right into the code in my poor father lead

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,240
that Ph.D. inside one of the top beams.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,620
I have a form for now it doesn't stop me to anywhere.

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,400
It actually has a few four sets off detection.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,210
And then right here we need to ECOs to use US Poulin.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:02,870
OK.

18
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,840
So first of all since I'm going to be agreeno these US plan something I knew to take off is I want to

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,980
autoload the use of subscriptions.

20
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,500
OK.

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:19,860
So right here I'm going to set up a protected with property and this is going to autoload the subscriptions

22
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,750
relationship.

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,380
OK.

24
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,280
Save that.

25
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,820
And in my profile I can do stuff like this.

26
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:38,970
I think I can just Ecorse the authenticated user and I'll get subscriptions and I'll get the first and

27
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,850
I'll get the name of the subscription.

28
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,840
Now you need to understand something Lavoe cashier provides the possibility for users to have more cheaper

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,740
subscriptions because you can have an application where a user can be subscribed to maybe vigils and

30
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,810
subscribe to maybe music in stand so you can have multiple subscription so you use.

31
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,490
So in this case we are up about around the fact that the user can have just one subscription at a time.

32
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,910
That's why we keep saying first such that we know or we make sure that the user can subscribe to just

33
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,800
one subscription and we always get the first right to our king.

34
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,250
So in this case we get the first subscription and we get the name of the subscription or we just plead

35
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,070
to the user.

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,320
OK then right here we need to submit this to somewhere.

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,570
So I'm going to just set up a route and I'm going to call these subscriptions to change.

38
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,450
OK.

39
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,890
Which is going to be a post and that when we click on this is going to submit the form value.

40
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,470
OK.

41
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,620
So I'm going to head over to my web ph be and I'm going to quit this route.

42
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,900
So I'm going to change this to a post and it's going to go to subscription change and subscriptions

43
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,680
control or change my thought and I'll give this a name which is going to be exactly what I coded in

44
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,770
my profile that made that pitch be.

45
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,180
So I'm going to copy this idea save it and I'll paste it right here.

46
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,740
OK.

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,670
So that's our world.

48
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,890
We need to create this change method in a subscription schedule.

49
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,660
So that's what I'm going to do.

50
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,170
Function change and it's going to be a pause right.

51
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,620
So first of all the first thing we want to check to make sure that we actually bodging a controller

52
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,750
is if the request parm that was passed in here is actually a different one.

53
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,210
OK.

54
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,500
So first of all we have to use on.

55
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:39,750
So let's just use our equals of user and let's just say use up plan course user will get his subscriptions

56
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,630
will get the first call and you get the plan name.

57
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:55,110
Ok then what you want to do here is check if request plan which is the new plan that you use wants to

58
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:02,220
change to right here the name of this selects plan and we want to check if the request line is equal

59
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,920
to the use of plan.

60
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:04,610
OK.

61
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:14,260
So the current plan or the use is of course a question and then we'll just return they use our back.

62
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,120
OK.

63
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,630
We don't want him to change anything if it's the same.

64
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,470
OK.

65
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,490
So the next step we need to call our subscription change process.

66
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:30,650
This method requires us to get a subscription and then it also requires us to call or swap method.

67
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,370
And we're going to explain what this means.

68
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:38,360
So first of all they want to do is actually strip out this implementation with Strype plan.

69
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,120
OK.

70
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,900
Even though the name of our plan is the same as the Strype plan.

71
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,970
I want to use a stripe plan so that we actually know this is exactly what we have in our strategy but

72
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:54,060
so is the plan that you use is on the same plan that we are getting from our view that we are going

73
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,290
to win on ideas of.

74
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,270
Okay then the subscription.

75
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,240
Right here it's 6 in the the plan.

76
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:07,400
So we're passing use our plan and then we're going to swap it for the new plan that we are getting from

77
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,550
the request.

78
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,380
So if they use our strengths upgrade for months later yearly loveall is going to pass this plan to allow

79
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,700
a cashier and automatically level cashier with calculates what is Judy use our or how much they use

80
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,220
on these to be charged for that are going to succeed and it's going to automatically do that.

81
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,740
OK.

82
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,540
So we use our subscription.

83
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,330
But in the current use up plan.

84
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:36,650
In this case maybe monthly or yearly and then it's going to swap it out for this plan that was passed

85
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,480
in the request makes sense.

86
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:45,230
So after this operation let's just return a redirect back ok for now.

87
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:45,820
OK.

88
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:54,050
So we get the plan and then we swap out the current plan right here with the new plan that we have for

89
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,020
our funds.

90
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,790
OK so let's go ahead and try this out in Abrazo to see what we get.

91
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:06,000
So right here we'll just select the Yelp plan because it's safe I said the monthly plan and recoup and

92
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,860
change plan and then sticking a little bit of time because he's communicating with us tripes serve our

93
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,280
change of plan and now we have a response.

94
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,680
So it refreshes and goes back to the speech.

95
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,140
OK.

96
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,170
So it seems your current plan is still monthly.

97
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,040
So let's go ahead to think I get this use on naturally see what is going on.

98
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,380
I'm going to show you right here and I'm just going to get all my users and I'm going to look for the

99
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,800
patch I use only walking the earth right now.

100
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,180
So they use all its name.

101
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,130
So what is happening is if you look at the first subscription for this user.

102
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,200
First of all the name is monthly.

103
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,020
That's why we are seeing monthly right here.

104
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,810
But the plan is yearly.

105
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:51,190
So this trapline is the name of the plan that we use I subscribe to on our Strype dashboard.

106
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,230
So this is the plan that Strype notes.

107
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,180
And this is simply a name that we give to identify the users plan on our own database.

108
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:58,740
OK.

109
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,370
So something of a level cache's if we swap out the plan it's going to change the strike plan name right

110
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:04,760
here.

111
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,760
But the name of the plant itself does not change.

112
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,250
Okay.

113
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:14,690
So it's a choice if we want to manually upgrade the name of the plan right here or what we can actually

114
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:22,700
do is change the the way we are to explain this to the user so we can actually display the strike plan

115
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:29,570
right here which actually makes the name kind of useless birched if you will automatically updates the

116
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,450
name of the plan when they use a subsidy out.

117
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,310
Then you can do that in your control.

118
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:34,970
Okay.

119
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,600
So if I come back refresh and we check out the plan we see that the Strype plan is yearly.

120
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,190
Okay.

121
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:46,160
And then we can switch back to the monthly and if I can change plan.

122
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,990
You say it's taking some time because it's complicated with the tripes service and then it comes back

123
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,740
with a response.

124
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,470
If you check that out it's switched to yearly.

125
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:54,970
Okay.

126
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:00,920
So just that simple math thought that actually helps us to actually switch the plan of the user whenever

127
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,150
they use our request.

128
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,940
And for one more thing let's just put a little bit of security for our service right here by saying

129
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,210
validates the request that is coming in.

130
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,590
And I would say the plan is required.

131
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,060
OK.

132
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,270
So that's it for this lesson in the very next one.
