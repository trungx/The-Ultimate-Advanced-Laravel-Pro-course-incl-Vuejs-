1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,880
OK guys like we agreed we're going to start working with VGX.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:10,740
We just try API to tokenized our costs and then we finally subscribe our users to our plan.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,590
So let's go ahead and get started.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:19,790
Remember in the payments checkout we got the reference so that we can learn how to customize this model.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,320
OK.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,160
So first thing right down here you want to go to the on top and then we're going to see what we need.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,620
Looks like we need to import the stripe library and then we create a custom button and then we'll go

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,270
on from that.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,150
OK.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,940
So first of all let's just create a view just component that is squeege be in charge of payments.

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,000
We tried.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,630
OK.

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,940
Or create a new component.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,490
And I'm just going to call each tribe the view then I'm going to reduce the other components in my OP.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,030
The Japs done and now I can use this components in my template.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,690
So just for starters I'm going to head right to my views right here.

17
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,640
I'm going to create or subscribe that blade Ph be.

18
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:12,390
And then I'm going to just duplicate my profile page page study and move out all the markup like the

19
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,820
contents that we have right here.

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:20,100
And Dan also right here we need to pull off some of these methods and we can just change this header

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,170
to see subscribe to our or some sites.

22
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:30,900
Ok so now we have this what we can do here now is Mullens our com partner and so we can see what is

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,590
going on.

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,280
So views tripe and what have you.

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,550
Strype But then look at the first step is for us to include this script right here.

26
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,810
So how do we conclude it.

27
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,940
Remember we don't want to put it in the obviously that BHB If not it's going to be included in all of

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:54,000
our HMO pages or all of the beaches on the site which we don't want because we aren't mounting this

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,340
component everywhere right.

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,430
So we're going to talk.

31
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:04,860
I wanna lay out for the rest of my of the believe that should be in right down but some or maybe preferably

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,950
at the top so it's low that first.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,270
Can you add a new section and I'm going to call the section scripts.

34
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,080
Okay.

35
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,150
Then I'll head over to my subscribe.

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:24,870
I'm going to quit a new section here called scripts and section and right here I can include my CGM

37
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,480
link.

38
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,130
OK.

39
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,630
So this creep right here I'm going to copy it or I'm going to paste it here.

40
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,270
OK.

41
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:36,460
Then let's head over to our Web page and create a simple route so that we can view that beach so routes.

42
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:45,780
It's going to be a Gad's VCDs tribe to visit said that's this or simply return a view which is exactly

43
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,460
to view the creator called subscribe.

44
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,060
OK.

45
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,100
Maybe we should actually call the SUBSCRIBE quite okay.

46
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,240
Now we'll visit the SUBSCRIBE watch.

47
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,390
We're going to see this view and hopefully if everything goes well that should be brought in.

48
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,910
Which is the scripts it should be you that right here form this view.

49
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,490
OK.

50
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,040
That said I've also had a lot of occasion.

51
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,910
This is lots of Skype viewers subscribing to found what do they do.

52
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,510
OK.

53
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,820
That's my forte.

54
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,140
Supposed to be subscribe with a B.

55
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,080
OK.

56
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,060
Refresh everything.

57
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,110
What now.

58
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,610
We check out our page source.

59
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,450
There we go.

60
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,270
We have Dart's scripts know that for us.

61
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:29,790
OK.

62
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,030
So let's check other documentation.

63
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,230
So looks like we need a Butson sort of knowing the user clicks on that button.

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,510
It opens up the Modahl that we saw right here.

65
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,030
So we are customized in the normal way so that we understand how it works and then we know how to maybe

66
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,820
make any changes that we want to do.

67
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,550
OK.

68
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:54,860
So after including this link we need to create a button so I don't my strap that you on we need a template.

69
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,760
And sure enough we need a script.

70
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:07,110
And in this template I'll have a button and this is when you see subscribe to the $9 plan monthly.

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,840
OK.

72
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:14,450
So it is and much Butson success and looks like we have a bottom for the monthly plan.

73
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,300
Right.

74
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,530
So if I head back to this and refresh.

75
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,590
Looks like we have our Butson right there.

76
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,250
OK.

77
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,410
So remember we have jewelry plans.

78
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,900
So we need to set up two Botswana's So our change is too much on food for example.

79
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,600
And I would change this two things nine dollars yearly.

80
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,110
Okay.

81
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,910
So the user chooses what plan.

82
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,630
And remember we can have this so we're going to wrap this in a day so we have just one word elements

83
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,750
refresh.

84
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,180
Great.

85
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,520
We have the monthly We have a yearly.

86
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,120
Now the next thing we need to do are cut into our documentation is create a handle on the cost track

87
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:59,880
check out and we call the configure meathook we pass in the key we pass in the image that we want to

88
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:07,330
be displayed for example right here this image so we pass the link to the EMH and then we call look

89
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:15,500
how so much can determine the low cost of the use of a levy person or to Kobar code to come which is

90
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,420
going to contain the token one stripe changes they use our credentials into stripe token.

91
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,820
OK so let me copy this and we'll have virtue of our script in our stride that you will create or Monserrate

92
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,680
who walk and or piece that in.

93
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,260
OK.

94
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,950
So we need a handler.

95
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:43,930
So we're going to create Konstanz handler because Strype checkout can figure out which person that objects

96
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,340
so just copy this right here and paste it right here.

97
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,530
Delete this.

98
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,690
We're done with it.

99
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,640
And looks like this function I'm just going to change everything.

100
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,840
So will be consistent with ESX.

101
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,830
So we have this method that is called once Treb makes an API call and changes the critical information

102
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,840
into a token.

103
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,430
OK.

104
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,340
Now we have the handler.

105
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:12,450
The next thing what do we do we need to set the button that is going to be clicked and then the handler

106
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,540
is going to be opened.

107
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,170
OK.

108
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,280
So open the model right here what you're doing is getting to the aliments with ID custom button right

109
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,790
here.

110
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:26,320
And then we are in the on events list now which is the click events to open the handler and after opening

111
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,920
each we can putting the critical information and all of that.

112
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,000
So how do we register our Click event handler.

113
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:40,270
I'm going to see when we click this button it should call my thought on this class called such Qype

114
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,500
for example.

115
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,470
But remember we are dealing with two methods the one for the area and one for the monthly.

116
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,660
So let's just see if you click on the month the button or the yellow button should pass in a string

117
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,890
called me into this subscribe method.

118
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,600
OK.

119
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,040
And on the subscribe for month week we're going to read you start to click events.

120
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:05,040
We're going to see call the subscribe misthought but this time around the permits are going to pass

121
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,130
in the stream call monthly.

122
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:15,450
So we have subscribed Matho less created or my thoughts object we call subscribe and this takes in the

123
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:15,890
stream.

124
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,870
So we're going to call that string plan.

125
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,170
What are we going to do is check if the plan is monthly.

126
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:31,220
So if the plan is mostly the regular set this is the plan it calls monthly and else would set this up

127
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,250
plan to be quote you yearly.

128
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:34,770
OK.

129
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,960
So we were referring to is this the plan.

130
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,630
So where don't we set it as a dieter are on this component.

131
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:48,570
So we'll have to return an object and plan would be an empty string by default.

132
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,250
OK.

133
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,970
So we check the plan.

134
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:57,280
We see it on dishcloths and then we're going to proceed to opening the handload.

135
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:57,970
OK.

136
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,360
So how do we open the lock need each pass in the name description and the imams.

137
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,840
So looks like we also need to know the amounts for the monthly.

138
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,660
Therefore we're going to say this the Amman's is a quarter to nine and nine because remember we are

139
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,940
pricing it in sense.

140
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:21,700
And if it's the yearly plan we also need to say this that Amman's is of course 9 99 99.

141
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:22,500
Okay.

142
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,140
Because it really wants $99.

143
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:25,710
OK.

144
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,310
So let's just set up our margins on this should be zero.

145
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,340
And I'm actually saving this because we're going to be making an API a quarter or so that's how quick

146
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,330
the subscription.

147
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,510
And we need to pass in the plan which fits the monthly on the.

148
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,190
So we better have this on our global data right here.

149
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:43,950
Okay.

150
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:50,060
So once we said that we already know if it's the monthly or the we need to open O'Hanlon Okay.

151
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:57,480
So we need to be able to assess the hand-glass when we do this would see this doc had a lot.

152
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,490
It's a cultural structure.

153
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:05,260
Therefore we have a handler right here which is known by default.

154
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,990
So when the complaint is it we save the stripe chicle configuration and once we save that in the hard

155
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:18,010
luck we are able to call the subscribe mid-thought when these two buttons are clicked on.

156
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,820
My thought is going to know if it's the monthly or the yearly plan and if it's not it's going to happen.

157
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,150
The handler with the correct credentials.

158
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,850
So distant hard luck that open.

159
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,800
Are we passing an object just like the Drene right here and we need to pass the name description and

160
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,610
Amman's.

161
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:44,790
So I would say name is but cost description is maybe but cost subscription and the amounts is going

162
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,340
to be this are months.

163
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,090
Okay.

164
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,310
So when we click on the subscribe button that is what should happen.

165
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,340
Great.

166
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,170
Let's check this out also to see if it makes any sense.

167
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,640
Let's click on that and look at that.

168
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:04,250
We have a quote from nine dollars that's close this gets to go to the $99 plan.

169
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,700
And now we have ninety nine dollars right here to pay.

170
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,160
OK.

171
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:13,010
So that's our broadcast subscription and this is the image we poured in.

172
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,490
OK.

173
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,200
So I want us to put hold right here and continue in the very next video.

174
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,540
But just to recap on what we've been doing we have our soaps Qype.

175
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:27,400
We included the Cdn link for the Strype checkout GNAS and non-strike that you.

176
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:34,060
We registered this event Knysna which is a click it passes in monthly and passes in the yearly into

177
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,550
the subscriber mid-thought which is right here.

178
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:42,280
And also scrubland thought is simply making sure that the component is a way that it's on the monthly

179
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,840
plan on the yearly plan setting the correct amount on the correct plan name.

180
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:47,460
OK.

181
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,190
And then we just opened the Hadleigh as usual just like we have in the documentation right here.

182
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,710
OK.

183
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,800
So let's continue building on this in the very next episode.
