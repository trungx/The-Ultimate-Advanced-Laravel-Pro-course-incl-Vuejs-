1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,120
Like grabbing the last video when we have a luggin response which is positive Ravell is going to generate

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,700
a session all the log in attempts and call authenticated method on this trait.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,920
So what are we going to be doing is actually creating these authenticated method in the controller.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,210
So I'm just going to copy the templates that we have and for the purpose of this video I read said a

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,800
test user that we could use larger ships in with issues use of factory that we could use.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,190
So I just use this for each region of the news using Peachtree or San Diego.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,830
So I'm going to copy the templates that we have here.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,210
There we go.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,340
I'm going to cut it out.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,140
Truly sort of a writer.

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,430
So in my log in control I'll paste that in and sure enough I need to import the request class right.

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,250
So I'm just going to copy this path and make sure I use it at the top.

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,810
Use eliminate S2P request and automatically inject the request for us.

14
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,470
So what do we want to do.

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:02,150
We want to test to see or make sure that level is going to call this method once the logging is successful.

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,620
So let's just start by returning a string.

17
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,780
So when the result is successful we're lovers of article you can call these authenticated thoughts and

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,610
know what to do.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,510
So we should expect a loggin successful response when we visit a browser.

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,430
Let's check this out.

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,430
Go to our logon page and are putting the e-mail of the user I created under password is secret by default

22
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,120
for Lavo.

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,470
Now click on mugging and sure enough we have this logging successful response that we gets from all

24
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,950
authenticated MATHO.

25
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:37,800
So you see just by writing one single method we can actually completely switch form a view based logging

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,560
system to an AJAX based system.

27
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,450
So let's just jump street and try to make this walk from the front end.
