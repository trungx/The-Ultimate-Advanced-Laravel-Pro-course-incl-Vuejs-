1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,500
Work on bad guys I want to see us drive to things real quick.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,680
And the first thing is how to get the art that lessons.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,130
OK.

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,180
Because he was joking or serious.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,920
That we we don't have any thoughts to get the other lessons right here we just agin the lessons by the

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,840
ideas but we need a lot more thought that this other than by the episode numbers just like we precise

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,140
when we were creating them.

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:24,840
OK.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,730
So let's go ahead to assist us.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,950
Are we going to create a new test and get all that lessons for our series.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,510
So how is this going to look.

12
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,620
First of all let's create a series and then create some lessons for that series about three of them

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,980
and then we are going to call the get or that lesson my thought.

14
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,880
And then we are going to run some assertions to make sure that the lessons are in the correct order.

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:57,910
OK.

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,710
So let's get to it.

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,820
First of all we need to create the series right.

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,560
So what I would do is just like what we've been doing or just create a lesson and then automatically

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:16,110
it's going to generate a new series so factory creates and I'll specify for the lesson class and not

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:24,060
forget your import less on the top so that we have no errors but class lesson and work here let's just

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:30,420
import civies so used by Sui's and I'm going to just pull out this right here.

22
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:30,880
OK.

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,670
So we have our first lesson what they want to do is take control of the episode number.

24
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,320
OK.

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,940
So I want to specify this opposite number in exactly the way I wanted to show up to my viewers.

26
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:51,690
So I want this to be the second lesson in my playlist so I'm going to use 200 and I'm going to create

27
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,760
another lesson.

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,700
So lesson two.

29
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,240
It cost exactly the same thing right here.

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,160
And rather than passing in 200 I'm going to pass in 100 which means this is going to be the first lesson

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,190
in my playlist because remember we are trying to test how it's going to be in real life in real life

32
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,950
we can create a lesson and then assigned a video idea and everything and then discover that that lesson

33
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,300
is supposed to come later.

34
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,870
So you added the episode number and you put it before the other one.

35
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,440
Right.

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,580
So if you do this everything might blow up.

37
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,350
OK so we have to test so much at this at the time.

38
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,860
So we're creating a second lesson but it's going to play before the first one because we are going to

39
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,710
be using the EPS number to know which one comes first and which one comes last.

40
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,210
OK.

41
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:49,160
So right here we need to specify our series ID to make sure that it's also for service one.

42
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:56,630
And finally we're going to have a search and I'm going to specify that this is place number three and

43
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,460
this is going to be lesson.

44
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,860
And that's what we need for our series on our lessons.

45
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,400
Okay.

46
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,430
So call to get that lessons.

47
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,090
My thought we're going to see lessons.

48
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:14,180
It's going to be courtroom lesson series because remember this should be on the series class then would

49
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,920
call get all that lessons.

50
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,110
OK.

51
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,730
Now for our sessions.

52
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:28,050
First of all let's just make sure that any random element from this result that we have which is a collection

53
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,680
should be an instance of the lesson class.

54
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:38,390
So we're going to see days assert Einstein's awful lesson class and we'll get the lessons and we'll

55
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,730
get around them.

56
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:46,910
OK then let's US-CERT equals and let's think about this if we have the lessons.

57
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,950
If we if other the lessons then the first lesson in this collection should actually be listened to.

58
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,480
Right.

59
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,110
Because if either A by episode number but this should come first and then the last lesson in this collection

60
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,910
should actually be lesson.

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,650
Right.

62
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,390
And listen listen one right here should be in the middle.

63
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:06,940
OK.

64
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:17,690
So let's assert that lessons first and we can just check across the ID is equal to lesson to ID.

65
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,620
OK.

66
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:27,210
And let's also US-CERT equals that lessons lasts we can get the last use in the last mid-thought and

67
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,830
then I said that it's lesson to be ID.

68
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,430
OK.

69
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,860
So those are the questions we're going to be running.

70
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,340
Now let's run this test individually to see what we get.

71
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,990
PH BE YOU filter by this test.

72
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,080
OK so on only get that lesson.

73
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,660
My thought yes we would have to watch or see which that BHP and right down here we going to create a

74
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,750
get that license method.

75
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,840
OK.

76
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,290
Run that test again.

77
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,240
And now each of us culture a member function or.

78
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,480
Because we're trying to get one done for our collection but we need not.

79
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:15,300
So what do we do to get the other lessons we just need to Aadhar all the lessons by the opposite number

80
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,830
field in ascending order.

81
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,400
Right.

82
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:26,500
So we just see if we turn this license or that by oh let's see something where here.

83
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,810
If I caught a guy like this he's going to give me an error.

84
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,240
Why.

85
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,310
Because this lessens colony as a property is going to return to us a collection of all the lessons.

86
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,250
But calling it as a method is going to return to us an instead of the query builder such that we can

87
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:47,820
call Marco Rubio the Methos like all the by and would order by the number few.

88
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,340
And then we're going to make sure that we specify that it isn't are sending other such that the smallest

89
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,800
is at the bottom is at the top and then it'll keep it keeps going down and then OK and then we're going

90
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,970
to use that gets mid-thought so that it returns to us a collection.

91
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,490
OK.

92
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:15,090
So we turn this lesson's order by a piece of Namok in ascending order and then get the collection working.

93
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,490
So let's run this again.

94
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,770
And that's great I test passes.

95
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,390
So we are successfully getting all the other lessons for the CBS.
