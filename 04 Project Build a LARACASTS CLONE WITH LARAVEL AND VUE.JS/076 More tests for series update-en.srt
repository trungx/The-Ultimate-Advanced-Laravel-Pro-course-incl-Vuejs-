1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,600
This a little bit of money will be behind the scenes that test does not cover.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,230
So I want us to cover it right now.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,880
Remember we are solving this and we are making sure that we actually store it in the correct path.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,410
But we are not searching or making sure that we actually store exactly the same type of database.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:27,080
So we're going to assert that the database has an image field which matches exactly the same way we

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,890
want to store it in a database.

7
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:36,520
So how serious slash new series sayto that P and G.

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,660
OK because we are looking to the series.

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,320
No actually we are street slugging the sites who are receiving a subpoena.

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,000
Right.

11
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,080
So this should exist in our database if everything actually walked correctly.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,560
Right.

13
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,630
So let's run that yeah.

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:01:00,740
We have a failure because it doesn't fine that few because you've read notes or bouillotte C-rist mid-thought

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,820
right here when we are doing is simply assigning the MHRA to the filing.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,160
But what we want to do is actually make sure that will be precise.

17
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,370
We want to see Vicini that's a serious directory.

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,050
Right.

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,430
So if we run that says Now one I'm Lougheed successful but we didn't speak this up.

20
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:27,140
OK so now that we've covered that point in our test like us to write some few thoughts asked just to

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,590
make sure everything was as expected.

22
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,880
So we're going on right now that says to make sure that if the image is not lead to other foods do just

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,410
fine.

24
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:42,760
So probably caution sayst and M.H. is not required to update Sui's.

25
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:43,810
Okay.

26
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,930
So how will this look pretty much exactly the same thing.

27
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,730
But we are not going to be building that image so will disable exception handling for better or for

28
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,610
all than lugging the user side streets or create a series Faktor store range.

29
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,290
Then we need to make that post request.

30
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,760
So make the push request but this time around we are not going to pass that image.

31
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:14,950
So pull out that image field and then with a certain date that assert that the session exists and now

32
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:22,430
about assessing for us so each what we agreed to do is we're going to assert that that fire does not

33
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,350
actually exist.

34
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,150
Now how do we check if this fire is actually missing.

35
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,980
We're going to see a certain missing method should be used rather than the assert exists.

36
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,470
Okay.

37
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,960
And law will actually provide this vehicle.

38
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,210
So we are going to assert that we are updating that series.

39
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,570
There is no major study of that.

40
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:48,670
And finally let's assert that the database does not have an update to that image but it hasn't of the

41
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,940
title obviously.

42
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:57,710
So right now here we're going to assert the Tabby's hahs for the series table a slot with the new title.

43
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,800
That's what we want.

44
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,880
So we don't want our MHRA fuel to change.

45
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:08,570
We want to be mean the same therefore we are going to assert or I said that the data base has a series

46
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,770
with this same image you are.

47
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,270
Okay.

48
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,160
Meaning it did not change at all.

49
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,320
We still have exactly the same image.

50
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:17,980
Yes.

51
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,970
So this field is not Abita because we don't want to overload an image.

52
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,160
And we want everything to succeed as usual without the image.

53
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,970
Okay that's honestest.

54
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:37,610
We will talk to this one rollout and it's successful because we are still creating still updating the

55
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,040
title description without the M.H. view on that.

56
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,520
And we actually already took care of this in a co-op.

57
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,320
Yes.

58
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:51,260
So one last test we can naturally write is make sure that the title is required to update a series.

59
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:58,310
So also make sure that the discussion is required but in the next video I want you are to lead a little

60
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:04,490
bit of reflux off because I have so many clients in my control which I'm not comfortable with and I'm

61
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:13,370
actually having duplicate methe thoughts in my requests classes for example we have this series M.H..

62
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:19,050
In this class I knew exactly the other class for create Seuss image so we're going to take care of that

63
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,550
and the very next Viju great up.
