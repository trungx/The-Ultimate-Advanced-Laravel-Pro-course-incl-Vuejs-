1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,880
Research getting an error response on my server.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,720
But one thing we can do in the catch block to make sure we actually get some feedback so we use our

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,110
ears to set up some errors in our form.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,840
So what we're going to be doing is having an air force object and this object is simply going to be

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,760
just plain arrows in our phone.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,400
Once we get that error or from our database we could actually check the status of the error.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:29,130
OK so we can see if error or not response and naturally forced to get the on line response in the exhaust

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:35,660
area we need to get that response and we can get the stutterers and we can see if the status is 4:22.

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,280
That really means this you did not provide us with the correct logging details and we're simply going

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,550
to push to the object.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:52,250
This is the process that Bush and we have a message like we couldn't verify your account details.

12
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,010
OK.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,780
So that's good enough for us to do this let's just instantiate this find way.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,650
OK.

15
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:05,540
Then once we push that aerosol he automatically let's make sure we actually displayed in templates.

16
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:11,160
Barrett if this is a 1:56 it means everything went well on our site but the users credentials were not

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,800
correct.

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,880
But we cannot actually check if it was 9:42 maybe it's 500.

19
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,290
Now we could actually push through the airport and seen something went wrong.

20
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,840
Refresh and try again.

21
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,320
OK.

22
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,450
So that's what we have.

23
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,060
Let's take care of that in our template.

24
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,110
So right after we have a farm let's set up a default on alerts that are alerts of danger.

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,070
And this is simply going to be displayed Eve.

26
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,240
So evasion of the if condition are right here for us but that's greater than zero.

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,570
So if the arrows.

28
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,350
We actually it has more than one element that we're going to display this block.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:51,870
And are you afraid we may actually want this to just lead us so on at least and then we can actually

30
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:59,370
add a class of let's go up here and inside that or at least we can have this go up items.

31
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,440
Then we wrapped it in a V for our inheritance and simply Eckard error.

32
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,820
Now we have this ever seen.

33
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,820
It would be preferable for us to bind to a key which we might not really need to do but just to shut

34
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,910
all these errors.

35
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,330
Let's just go ahead and buying this to a key and see that index of error.

36
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,040
OK.

37
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,480
So that's just me.

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,300
Just shut up.

39
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,940
So now for each other that we have no where else are we we are simply going to actually output this.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,550
OK.

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,270
So another thing we want to do is make sure that if the user clicks on the attempts log in Marsan which

42
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,120
simply said this that error has to be called to an empty array again.

43
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,850
And by Thing that should do it for our validation.

44
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,210
Let's go ahead and try this out.

45
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,350
Open up our logon window and paste in our email.

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,330
Putting the wrong password.

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,700
Try to logging and sure enough we have that error all right even though it looks really really bad.

48
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,350
But then we have it right.

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,570
So now let's make a little change.

50
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,250
Try to log in again.

51
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,920
And the error goes away before coming back all over again.

52
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,560
Right.

53
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,540
So looks like authentication is working.

54
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,720
I'm going to take care of this really bad for my team behind the scenes.

55
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,290
But I think over 80 years of integration works perfectly.
