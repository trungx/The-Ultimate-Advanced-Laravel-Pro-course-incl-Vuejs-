1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:08,070
Our next step is obviously to be able to get the user credentials and then pass it to our Strype API

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,120
which is going to return to us a token.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,860
OK.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,690
So we should click on this right now.

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,100
It looks like we need to fill in the email field.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,670
OK.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,390
But we already have an authenticated user and we collected his e-mail and we verify this e-mail right.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,130
So why don't we preview this email for the user.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,510
Our head of answers tribe and I'm going to show you why we are doing the custom rather than the simple

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,570
because the simple it's automatically just going to create this modem with the email feud and everything.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,780
But we the customer like we are doing now we can profundo custom use our e-mail.

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,830
So let's go ahead or subscribe that let that be.

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,180
And indeed we're going to pass in a property called e-mail and this pope is going to simply read the

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,420
authenticated users e-mails.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,770
So let's just say of us and then we'll get the e-mail.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,520
OK then who are straight view components.

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,470
We need to restart that.

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,470
So right here I'm going to save props and this will be Himmelman right down at the bottom when we are

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:14,090
opening the handler what we can do is set an email property which is going to be Koetsu this the Himmelman.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,940
OK.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,040
So that's the sort of Vasa refresh.

22
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,480
Click on the yellow line.

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,750
And now we have the email automatically filled in right here.

24
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,870
So we just need to use US quilted card information and then we can pay.

25
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,600
Right.

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,430
So now if we fill in these credentials I naturally click on eBay it's going to get the talken for us

27
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,350
because what we want to do is transform this car and this field this field into our token and then we're

28
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,150
going to charge that so can actually use a of cash.

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,120
So this method right here is going to be in charge of the callback once the token is acquired from Strype

30
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:48,820
API.

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,500
OK.

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,550
So remember we need to get took on and then we get the idea.

33
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,200
So this is what are going to do right here.

34
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,370
We're going to make an API request Lovell.

35
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,600
But for now let's just console that lock.

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,290
So can I.

37
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,640
So you understand what we've been doing on the square.

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,680
So I'm gonna open up my console refresh this

39
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:19,040
get my console right there and then we're going to create a monthly subscription so that it's going

40
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,070
to open up more than we're going to put in a press conference try putting any date in the future and

41
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,190
then putting any CC number.

42
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:33,470
So it's going to make that IPO request to try get a token and then it's going to Peyster token right

43
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:33,800
here.

44
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,740
So that said we're getting toucans successfully from Strype this Treptow can actually represent a token

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,580
that is passed in here into almost lover Kashima.

46
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,110
So when we pass this token lovers are automatically going to call the strypes server again.

47
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,840
And then it's going to touch the user.

48
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,450
OK.

49
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:55,190
So looks like for us to charge a user or unsubscribe into a new subscription we need to pass in the

50
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,540
name of the subscription plan just like we're having it here right here.

51
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,550
So if it's monthly We need to Lavo it's one fee or if it's yearly When it's it's all over it's yearly

52
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,540
and that's it.

53
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,710
And then we need to pass in the striped sugar.

54
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,320
OK.

55
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:15,140
So why don't we do this let's just do this in a really fast way let's just import Agios from XOs.

56
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:15,960
Right.

57
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,750
And then we're going to make that excuse post request.

58
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,650
So exhausted post and would simply call and subscribe and point I wanted to pass in the data.

59
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,350
We're going to pass in Strypes or can and is going to be tokened of ID.

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,710
And we also note pass in the plan which is going to be destock plan y.

61
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,850
But then it's not going to work that way.

62
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,200
And I promise you that I'm just going to show you right here.

63
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:42,770
Okay.

64
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,320
So let's just we make this request like this.

65
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,970
I'll head over to my Web site.

66
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,270
Create that thought.

67
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,880
So it's a route and it's a post it subscribe.

68
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:57,170
I will just use a closure right here and just return request on.

69
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:57,780
OK.

70
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,440
So let's try Shrader as soon as we receive a token from Strype we're going to make that exist post a

71
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,290
question that end point and passed in the To.

72
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,020
And the plan.

73
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,700
OK.

74
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:15,290
So let's make that request refresh right here off and frustratedly see the results from the server let's

75
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,980
actually subscribe to that and get the response we can so that Lauck response.

76
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:21,540
OK.

77
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,770
Now let's refresh and make sure we make that request.

78
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:32,050
OK so Scratchie early plan pass in effect credit card pass in a future date and passing efficiency.

79
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay be Strype creates that or can it makes that API request to our backend server and then we have

80
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,450
the dates of return.

81
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,080
Remember we have returning requests.

82
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
All right.

83
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,300
But look at what's happening.

84
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,470
We're just passing in the Strype took on what happened to the plan.

85
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,490
It means we are plan our plan is not truly reaching the server.

86
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,410
And this is simply of javascript right here because we are in this object.

87
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,320
And then we have a method inside a nested object and then we are trying to reference this.

88
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,130
And this can no longer refresh to view.

89
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,360
OK so we can't get into the instance if we code this right here.

90
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,050
So what we're going to do is we're going to make a little trick and that's this right here we're going

91
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:21,980
to see window that stripe line equals monthly All window the stripe plan accordingly.

92
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,740
OK so we're going to save it on the global when the objects are there we can access it from anywhere.

93
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:32,810
And then when we strip save it under global window what we're going to do right here is for the plan

94
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,520
we're going to see we know the straight line should be what is passed into this plan property.

95
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,100
Okay.

96
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:44,360
So this is simply a problem of accessibility we can assess the view instance from a nested mid-thought

97
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,120
inside the nested object.

98
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:46,820
OK.

99
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,100
So this should get us to Strype plan.

100
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:56,900
Let's reset our browser refresh and then let's get a new plan pass in a really current and future dates

101
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,470
and pay.

102
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,530
And there we have the dates are and our data now have the monthly plan because we quicken the monthly

103
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,080
right.

104
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:10,700
So let's walk back and remember how the resubscribed use us to our plan.

105
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:17,900
Easy as milk we simply call off user create a new subscription and this subscription will be called

106
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,000
the request plan.

107
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,200
So for us monthly plan then we're going to pass in my plan.

108
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,520
It was a yearly plan we are also going to pass in yearly plan and we're also going to pass in the same

109
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,920
request plan as a second parameter.

110
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:37,000
And we're going to call the crew yet Smith thought and we're going to pass in request Strype token.

111
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,820
OK.

112
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,470
So look at this.

113
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,020
We're just doing exactly what was in the Lavoe documentation nothing strange.

114
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:44,730
OK.

115
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,600
So we have this new subscription thought and the first parameter here is the name of the subscription

116
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,450
the way we want to see it in our database.

117
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:58,760
The second parameter here is the name of the subscription on our stripe dashboard.

118
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,920
So on our stripe dashboard we've named it as monthly or yearly and in our database we want to see it

119
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,390
as monthly or yearly.

120
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,300
So that's why we passed with BREASTPLATE-MAKER and we Crestline right here.

121
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:16,070
And then for Quitman thought we need to pass in the so can and just like we did with our XOs we are

122
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,020
passing in stride.

123
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,490
So can I say the key right here and that's how we assess in the choir here.

124
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,000
OK.

125
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,610
So once this is Dawn why don't we simply return it.

126
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,860
So return this.

127
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,510
And I think this is going to return to us the subscription that they use I was just subscribed to.

128
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,110
OK.

129
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,700
So let's go ahead and try this.

130
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,780
And actually this is going to create a new subscription in our database.

131
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,740
And it's also going to create a new subscription on our Strype dash board.

132
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,420
OK.

133
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,030
So I just thought of something right now.

134
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,430
Let me just repayed right here.

135
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,240
So PSP or Sun Cincom and I'm going to get all the users.

136
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:51,890
Yeah.

137
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,150
And thought so I'm using this e-mail as my test account.

138
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,920
But actually I already have a stripe plan on my dashboard where I was testing some stuff.

139
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,560
So all I want to do is actually change the e-mail.

140
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:11,130
So use of course but carriers use are for us and would simply update the e-mail to be something else.

141
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,370
So maybe klutzy friends.

142
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,700
My mail the com and save the e-mail.

143
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,360
OK.

144
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,170
So I think we're good to go for a refresh now.

145
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,730
And we click on subscribe.

146
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,550
OK we have that in your e-mail.

147
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:32,000
So if everything was well we should have a stripe subscription now or stripe dashboard how much of a

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,580
new subscription in our database so a spouse in a credit card plus under fake month of expiration.

149
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:47,570
Plus in the fake CVC and pay OK it's made that EPA request which made the request to Lovelle cashier

150
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,810

152
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,540

153
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,000

OK.

155
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,760
So look at the data.

156
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,470
We have a response right here which contains the strypes subscription in our database.

157
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,470
So let's reset our stripe dashboard.

158
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:12,610
So if you check out our Strype dashboard right here in the Where We have a Pieman just now right here.

159
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,160
OK.

160
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,950
So we have a new payment right here of nine point nine dollars which is what we just did.

161
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:27,640
OK then if we check out on our database using thinka if you get used up and we get subscriptions we

162
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:34,190
just go that this user has a new subscription and the subscription is a monthly one that we just set

163
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:34,970
up right now.

So we are actually successfully subscribing use us to plans in our application but then we don't want

167
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,550
to do it like this right.

168
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:53,180
It's kind of sapi having a wildfire fire with this methode and then making a request with view and waiting

169
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,010
for a long time before receiving a request response.

170
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,130
OK but we're going to tackle these in the very next video.
