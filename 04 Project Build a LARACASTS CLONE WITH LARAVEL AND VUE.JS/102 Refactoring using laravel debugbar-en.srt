1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,820
A really cool Lavoe package that is going to help us debug applications or cool make applications better

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,130
a Lavazza What about go ahead and install it.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:17,410
And if you use 5.5 like I am all you need to do is you want to compose or require Lavoe debug by as

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,550
modified by here and that's if you're ready to use it.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,880
So I've installed that.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,050
And if you can see in all my views I have this bar right here.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:33,570
Now check out this page where we are actually viewing the lesson and we have our player up check out

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,490
for example what we have here.

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:42,390
We have analysis for everything the view routes queries and if you check right here it gives us information

10
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:49,110
about the queries you see we have to have statements executed on my skill database and several of them

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,420
were to be catered.

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:56,160
And that's really really powerful performance right because we can't make a query and then make it several

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,050
times OK.

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,080
It really slows down our server as a complication.

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,760
So now why we have that is.

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,690
Look at this quavery right here to get the next and previous with creating that query once twice twice

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,920
up to seven times.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,070
Therefore to that application we're going to be using DEBUG by Chris.

19
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,690
We have the facts or check if everything has changed.

20
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,820
So we actually have no duplications.

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,370
OK.

22
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,270
So let's go ahead and take care of that.

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,570
Now the idea I have our head of it's my watch that let that be is we can either pass that get previous

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,210
lesson and get that lesson from our control.

25
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,130
But I don't want our controllers to be bloated.

26
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:46,290
So what we can do is actually get it right here so we can open up here and BHB and we can assign next

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,490
lesson.

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,910
They want to be go to a lesson get next lesson right here.

29
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,590
OK.

30
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,370
And this is totally OK.

31
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:02,670
We can also get previous lesson because the lesson get previous lesson right here.

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,130
OK.

33
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:10,250
So just assigning those variables and right here we can see the next lesson.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,280
So rather than calling the math out again and making the query we see if next lesson and right here

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,390
we can see if previous lesson.

36
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,100
Okay.

37
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:28,590
And then this right here where we have that everyone forgets and the next lesson you all remember if

38
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,350
we don't have a next lesson it's going to actually break.

39
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,470
So what are we going to do is we're also going to rub it in an IF statement.

40
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,310
So if there is the next lesson then we're going to pass that prop to VGX.

41
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:47,110
So right here I'm going to see if next a lesson and if and if right here then we're going to pass this

42
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,510
problem.

43
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:55,500
OK then where we have our methods rather than calling next lesson we can just see next lesson ideas.

44
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,970
So we're using exactly the same vailable.

45
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,290
Therefore no queries.

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,420
OK so right you also get the next lesson will change this too.

47
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:09,770
Next lesson I will get the idea get this lesson what changed at your previous lesson.

48
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,150
I will get the idea.

49
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,260
OK so I think we touched everything.

50
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:20,910
Let's just refresh now to see if our number of course has reduced refresh and we have unsurvivable.

51
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,100
The lesson.

52
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,700
All right here.

53
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,010
I'm sorry that's because I'm in the Capitol.

54
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,210
It's supposed to be a small.

55
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,410
I'm sorry about that.

56
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:36,150
Refresh our case so let's look at what we have line statements executed only to where duplicator and

57
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,750
7 way unique.

58
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,320
OK.

59
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,510
But I think what we actually did fix the Evreux about Vista in the next speech.

60
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,550
Let's try this next lesson.

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:52,160
And this is actually the last lesson and we don't have that error because the problem is pastur veejays

62
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,440
now is not.

63
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:01,130
So if we checkout view and check out our play our next lesson is undefined.

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,810
OK.

65
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:08,330
Now let's head over to us to Hopley and Reaganites how sweet a lot what to do.

66
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,590
So here is not just play video in that other thread we're going to see if there's not next lesson your

67
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,070
all then what we going to do is display this.

68
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,180
Right.

69
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:28,810
And then if we don't have that then we simply cannot just play this right here.

70
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,230
You complete that this series because that's the last lesson.

71
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:34,640
Right.

72
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,920
So he's completed this series and then nothing happens.

73
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,720
But then if we have a next lesson then he's going to redirect to the next lesson.

74
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,810
OK so let's try this out.

75
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,550
Hard refresh.

76
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,950
Let's start with the previous lesson and I'm just going to ask for my plea to the end.

77
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,790
And yeah we have the alerts.

78
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,580
If I click on OK it redirect that me to the next lesson automatically if I played this one and just

79
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:06,290
phosphide to the end are so great we have the ACA you completed this series.

80
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,300
OK.

81
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,140
That's great.

82
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,670
Yeah.

83
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,620
So you might want to maybe redirect the use outside the home page after he completes the series.

84
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,610
Or you might want to do nothing at all like we're doing right now.

85
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:25,390
It's all OK and it depends on you but we are not tracking the success of the use of we are not yet knowing

86
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,020
if he has complete other series or something like that.

87
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:35,860
So what we need to do right now is play that and then when the vision has and that we need to fire an

88
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,650
Ajax request to the server.

89
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,910
Complete the lesson for the user.

90
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:47,280
And then when we receive a confirmation from our server then we want to display video and that alerts.

91
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:47,890
OK.

92
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,350
Try to figure that out.

93
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,970
Are we're going to do it together in the next lesson.
