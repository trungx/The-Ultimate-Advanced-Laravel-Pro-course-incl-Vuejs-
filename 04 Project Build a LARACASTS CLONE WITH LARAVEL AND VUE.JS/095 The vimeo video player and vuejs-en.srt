1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,300
You guys will come back.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:10,350
This is where we end up on this page and this is a page where the whole project is about we want to

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,720
be able to watch her series and learn something.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,400
OK.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,660
So we're going to be using Vimeo.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:23,570
Now the reason why the reason Vimeo is it's really really hard to host your own videos because there

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,730
is a lot to take into consideration.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:34,410
Streaming processing and taking care of hosting space port processing the video when the video is uploaded

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,540
and all of that stuff.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,560
So it's better to use a video provider like video or YouTube.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,150
OK.

12
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,470
So Vimeo provides the possibility of hosting your videos and once you host your videos you can make

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,140
the videos Private and specific to particular domains.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,040
For example when we deploy these projects all the videos that are going to be on this website are only

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,730
going to be able to be embedded on this Web site.

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,370
OK.

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,910
So that's what V.M. provide to us and you need to be at least I think the premium plan or the preplan

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,600
don't know you have to check it out okay.

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,510
So the API is open if you are embedded with Windows it's open free.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,060
OK.

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,350
So we're going to be using the video player and remember once a video is completed we need to mark that

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,060
the user has completed this video right.

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,100
So install the player and install that.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:34,960
If you check out my history right here I have NPM installed see if Vimeo play up and it's installed.

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,600
Then once you install it let's go ahead and do some VHS magic to have that play out right here.

26
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,250
OK.

27
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,600
So let's create a video player or component.

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,040
So in my component's directory I'm going to create a play or that view and this is going to contain

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,810
my player.

30
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,670
So templates I'm gonna have a script.

31
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,000
And for now I'll just put in a D for a cure.

32
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,760
OK.

33
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,730
So let's register the component in my Abdur.

34
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:07,460
Jess right here I'm going to see view the component and this is going to be a view player and will require

35
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,570
components play clear that view.

36
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,860
OK so now we want our player to work that's the code of documentation for a bit.

37
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,540
And what do we see here.

38
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,920
You can install the product in many different ways.

39
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,770
But what we want is right here.

40
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,310
OK.

41
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,640
There are a lot of ways you can actually use an embed.

42
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,180
And they will pass in the ID.

43
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,580
Remember we have the ID stored in the database right.

44
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,600
For this particular video we have the ID stored in the database so we can pass it in into the component

45
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,470
and maybe concatenated to the I-frame and play it.

46
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,850
But the simplest way is right here automatically with SDMI attributes.

47
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,150
We can have a Z if.

48
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,300
And then we have a video id property or attribute.

49
00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:02,890
And then we pass in the video ID into that play up and then specify the width and then we can give that

50
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,730
an ID.

51
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,970
And then in our code we simply create a new video player.

52
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,450
I'll show you how this works.

53
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:15,750
Let me copy that line and in our template I'll paste that in and what it simply does is remember VMO

54
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,930
ID that this is the pujo Id like we start in our database and then we have the ID which we can just

55
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,490
leave us one stake then in our code we need to import V.M..

56
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,830
So import player from Vimeo player.

57
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,810
Ok then we can reference our mounted hawk.

58
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:45,500
So as soon as this component is mounted in our code what is going to happen is we can we can see constant

59
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,390
player is a new player and we have options right here.

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:58,030
We can pass in the parameter which is going to be id of the element we want to mount our player on.

61
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:04,730
So were going to pass in hand steek right here and automatically we going to have a new player right

62
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,130
here.

63
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,630
OK.

64
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:11,790
So I'm going to go to my watch that played a b a b and right here we have column 12.

65
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,500
I'm going to mnze view player.

66
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,530
So this is just like I have in my Abda just right.

67
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,370
So you play.

68
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,840
And then I use that to match few players.

69
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,310
So I have my watch out with the one in behind the scenes.

70
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,520
It's watching everything.

71
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,910
And then I'm going to head over to my browser or inspect and then a hard refresh.

72
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,730
And there we go.

73
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,760
We actually have that video image that automatically because we have a player right.

74
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,770
So.

75
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,320
So the player is going to provide us with lots of options.

76
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,310
For example check out the documentation if you need any help.

77
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:53,810
But we can listen to the play events and then do something so we can also live in to listen to the end

78
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,170
events and also do something right.

79
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,810
So what we are going to do is let's just test out the events.

80
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:07,120
So we are just going to see a player that on play just like we have here and then we're going to pass

81
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,840
in a close call for what is supposed to happen once the play event is triggered.

82
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,380
We're just going to console glauca our video explain.

83
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,380
So let's refresh.

84
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,850
And then when we click on that automatically the video is playing.

85
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,980
And we have this locked right here.

86
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,510
OK.

87
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,440
So let's go ahead and continue working on our player in the very next video.
