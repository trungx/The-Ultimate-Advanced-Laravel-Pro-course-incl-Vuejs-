1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,150
We ended up having to deal with these aerostat wars as soon as we applied our admin middleware.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,710
So let's go ahead and handle it in this video.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,290
And it seems like all of our tests that have to do with our building on CBS are failing because we need

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,150
to actually log in and treat all before doing this right.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,140
So why don't we actually log in the administrator right away before doing the test for us.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:30,390
We need a user right so far we generate a warning for the use of force and would that second we need

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,900
this user to be an administrator but then we have that config array that actually does this so how can

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,870
we tell of all these years I should be an administrator.

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,610
Let's head over to our config class provided by Lovell to see if we can find a way to do this.

10
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,060
So it was a treat that Ph be.

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,300
And actually if you bought it office you know in the luminal configuration we would have this repository

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,080
that ph be where the config class itself exists.

13
00:00:59,130 --> 00:00:59,600
OK.

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,520
So that class that implements the contract.

15
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,950
So let's browse the methods that we have here.

16
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,570
We have a husky or Hussman thought.

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,680
Get my folks get M.F. up a sudden thought a pre-planned method.

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,360
And I think what we are looking for is actually this method.

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,540
So push a value on one way configuration value and actually if you go through the Java documentation

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,330
you notice that it's highly recommended to actually push to the config or set to the config at runtime

21
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,100
rather than mocking the config class.

22
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,280
OK so let's go ahead and do this.

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:40,460
So we have our config Fasi and we can get to the push mid-thought and we're pushing to but cost that

24
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,900
ministry to us.

25
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,190
That's the reason we have you know buy cars of BHB.

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,850
Then we are pushing a value and that value should be the use that we just created.

27
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,320
And he's email right.

28
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,750
So creative use of course they use us email to the administrators are we.

29
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,020
And then finally what we want to do is allow the user or eat right.

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,580
So this acting us use on so before one is there let's just make sure we import our use config at the

31
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,990
top then let's run out the test.

32
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,290
Or you can add redounds for filling tests.

33
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,250
OK so this last one is actually succeeding because we are an administrator.

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,410
And we have the right to do this.

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,860
So we didn't duplicate in this solution every single place we want to on the streets or why don't we

36
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,720
create a cross.

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,200
Tom administrates all men thought that is going to help us logging in an administrator.

38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,520
What I want to do is actually we're friends.

39
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:42,410
This logging I mean my thought and this is going to join with an administrator and lucky me.

40
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,060
OK.

41
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,880
So I'm just going to cut this out.

42
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,580
So where do we put this.

43
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,460
We have a case that BHB if we check out this extents desk or we can use test case and test cases and

44
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,660
or a test or a tree.

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,500
So let's head over to that directory test that case the Ph.D. and we can put that in a public function

46
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,700
plugging at mine and paste that functionality right there.

47
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,140
OK.

48
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:13,540
So we have a factory therefore we need to port our use our class so used by us use our then use config.

49
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,200
And I think that should do it.

50
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,770
All right.

51
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:23,310
So they use OUR make sure they use are created as an administrator and then not to use are in.

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,650
OK.

53
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,210
So that's what our logging admin thought does.

54
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,880
That's one that's a loan to make sure that it still passes and it does pass.

55
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,980
Therefore we just need to duplicate this solution to all our tests that we're feeling like this one

56
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,460
we need to be Latina's I mean streets before it works.

57
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,880
Same here same here same here.

58
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,090
And this one doesn't require that.

59
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:47,930
OK.

60
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,560
So let's run all our tests right now to see if we actually have a difference.

61
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,180
Great.

62
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,950
Looks like I should be successfully running.

63
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,350
And we finally fixed all errors.
