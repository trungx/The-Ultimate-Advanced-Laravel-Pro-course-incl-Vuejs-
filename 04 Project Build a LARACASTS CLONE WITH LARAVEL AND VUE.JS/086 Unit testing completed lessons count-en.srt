1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,150
We already have an existing test to see that we can we can actually complete a lesson.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,600
Right.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,580
So rather than creating a unique test for our Get number of completed lessons we are going to really

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,150
test that functionality right here.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,720
OK.

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,880
So we are asserting that this is an investment thought for this particular key is going to return this

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:20,290
array.

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,740
Right.

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,540
So we're going to do is create another assertion and this will be our search equals and would call our

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,240
method.

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:34,980
So I would say they use or let me copy the method name get them off computer lessons for series or pay

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,900
study.

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,230
And we need to pass in the series so we'll just get less on CBS.

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,830
And we want to make sure that this method returns true because these are it contains two lessons that

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,610
we completed.

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,170
OK.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,390
So we want to said that this method returns too.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,370
I think this is going to help us actually make sure that this method works as expected.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,140
So we are back to running this test

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,200
and if we want it of course now it feels because too much is expected.

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,330
All.

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,500
So let's make that pass.

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:16,870
We're going to see this menthol should simply return this and will get as members.

24
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:25,970
And the key we are searching for is use our call on this ID card on Sirius.

25
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,960
CARLSON And Sirius ID.

26
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:30,740
OK.

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:39,040
So we get this Ari and we can now call Cowen's to get the counts of the elements in this area.

28
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,000
So if everything goes well this should actually pass right now because we are using Ready's automatically

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,790
to get that and then return the cons.

30
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,420
OK.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,250
So let's run that are angry.

32
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,370
Meaning that this test actually successfully passes not we've actually verified that we can actually

33
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,610
get the number of completer lessons for series for a particular user.

34
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,030
Now we're going to continue on with this test.

35
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:13,470
So let's run it and see the next arrow we have and we're successful right because this method now successfully

36
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,950
calculates the percentage right here just like we doing.

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,550
Okay.

38
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:24,150
So for us to make sure that we're actually really successful why don't we place 10 right here to make

39
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,170
sure that this is not just passing for some reason behind the scenes.

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,750
So we have a figure now so we have 50 but it feels expected 5 1 0.

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,950
So we should have and if we run that we are green again.

42
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,400
So thanks so much for watching.

43
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,430
Let's continue in the very next video with some riffraff all.
