1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,740
Right now when we delete a lesson it doesn't naturally go away from the door right.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,800
So let's handle that.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,210
Now how do we pull out from an array we can use javascript's default splice mid-thought.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,090
So for us to do that we need to know the index of that element.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,490
So why don't we actually parse the index to just delete my thoughts so I'm going to pass in a key and

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,150
this key is going to be gotten from here.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:30,140
So we could actually do this and get the key for the lesson and then pass it to this method.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:40,440
And then what we can do is like here we could see this are lessons that splice in the key and we'll

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,050
pass in one to see we move just one image right.

10
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,810
So looks like we need to receive the key right here.

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,340
And I think that's going to work.

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,850
So after a successful Gillett's we'll move that.

13
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,090
Let's go ahead and try this to see if it works.

14
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,530
Quick refresh OK.

15
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,100
So let's move less than four.

16
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,670
So looks like less than four.

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,410
That's great.

18
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,300
That's from this one.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,010
OK.

20
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,800
It's gone.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,170
This one too.

22
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,110
OK great.

23
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,490
Looks like it's working perfectly.

24
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:09,970
Great Joe.
