1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:06,270
OK next step we want to be able to check if the Czar has a plan and then we won't be debating him to

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,430
the white page if he doesn't.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,270
All we to permit him to watch here is if it's free.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:11,770
OK.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,770
So first of all we need to include the concept of having premium license therefore for this that will

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,330
not change to say something else.

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,100
So we'll be testing a use of we got a.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,400
Cannot watch premium license.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:25,870
OK.

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,860
So that's the test that we are going to be writing.

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,180
So first of all we need some lessons.

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,050
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to help you use our test to include the concept of premium lessons.

13
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:43,930
So create a treat for the lesson class on your Christmas thought.

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,280
And in this methode I'm going to pass in a key called premium and I've said this to one.

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,140
OK.

16
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,700
So we're going to have a database full call premium.

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,980
And then if this field is one then the lesson is premium.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,610
So next I'm going to pull this out for the moment then we're going to make a GET request to the end

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,350
point for the user to actually watch the video.

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,000
OK.

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,510
So basically what we want is if the user does not subscribe to our plan we were directing him to the

22
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,080
SUBSCRIBE page so he can subscribe to one.

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,650
But evidence do you use I subscribe to plan then we simply allow him watch the lesson.

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,270
OK.

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:28,340
So future cop outs are we have this get speech where we want to use or to watch the series.

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,470
So what are we going to do is we're going to visit this route right here and we're going to pass in

27
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,520
this lesson.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:35,930
OK.

29
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:43,110
So this should be a lesson right here for descriptive purposes and we need to pass in less lesson series

30
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:50,450
Boston to SLOC and then for the lesson right here in Lassan ID.

31
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:57,000
So when we make it get requests to this lesson which is a premium one would assert something.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,670
So I would assert that the use always redirects at that so that you use ours.

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,030
Actually we don't take that to the source quite beach.

34
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:04,590
OK.

35
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:10,950
So the by page remember is on gets and points where we see the subscription form.

36
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,410
OK.

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,360
So subscribe to some sites.

38
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:13,720
OK.

39
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,960
So that's what we want to happen.

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,940
Let's just try this out to see what we have not so far.

41
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,020
So let's run this.

42
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,240
We need to add to that last OK.

43
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,910
We haven't that sees or lessons has no on premium.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,490
OK.

45
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:40,150
Obviously so would have the much or create lessons to a bow and we're going to create a premium color

46
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,870
so say so.

47
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:51,260
And I want this to be a boolean and I'll call this preview and I'll just set this by default to be zero.

48
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,050
OK.

49
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,550
So run these again and half expect that there is.

50
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,050
And this is actually what we got so we read the log in page.

51
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,960
So we need to lock the user in before we try to recede.

52
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,450
Lesson for this.

53
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:05,870
Right.

54
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,250
So we're going to see this seen us use on.

55
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,590
So would love this user name for this testing session.

56
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,260
OK let's run that again.

57
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,450
Now we have a video response that's good to read it's not reader.

58
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,430
I started school.

59
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,210
So in our control we are not with damage and to use lots of the SUBSCRIBE page.

60
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:32,280
So let's go on with that B and right here this is what she was controul at the show less than I thought.

61
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,810
So watch series controller at the show lesson method.

62
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,470
Simply read debates.

63
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,250
It returns that view.

64
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,020
So what are you going to do is check if the authenticated user has our current plan.

65
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,750
So we'll see if you use.

66
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,620
And we haven't subscribed to non-menthol at that level because she gives to us.

67
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,400
That's actually just check the billable trade to make sure.

68
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,790
So if research subscribed.

69
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,190
So it's called subscribe to plan.

70
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:01,820
OK.

71
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:09,950
So what series if the US use or subscribe to plan then we can let him watch the series.

72
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,300
OK.

73
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:17,420
So we could check here if they got use or not subscribe to our plan then we need to redirect him so

74
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,480
we turn redirect.

75
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,480
And this would be to the SUBSCRIBE page.

76
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,080
OK.

77
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,860
So we're just checking if the user has a plan if he doesn't have a plan.

78
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:31,220
We will direct him to the beach and we can maybe add a flush procedure or something like that.

79
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,690
But tonight let's run that test.

80
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,800
OK we have a 500.

81
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,420
Looks like we're having an error or let's just about exception handling to see that error.

82
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,140
OK.

83
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,650
Run that again.

84
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,750
And we are having the last two few arguments passed to frosh and use us to plan.

85
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,270
OK let's check out what the method needs to seized.

86
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,750
I mean if those tribal areas if they subscribe to one of the given lines we need to pass in all the

87
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,650
plans that we want to use or do we want to check if the user is subscribed to.

88
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,290
OK.

89
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,500
So basically we passing on the plan.

90
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:15,350
So for example in the southeast or you a method way here we can pass in an array and stop monthly and

91
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,540
yearly.

92
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,440
OK.

93
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,790
So we want to check the use I subscribe to either monthly or yearly plan.

94
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,270
OK.

95
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,070
So let's run this again.

96
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:29,040
And now we have a successful test meaning that user is not subscribed to any plan.

97
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,980
And then he said automatically we make that to the subsequent beach.

98
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,550
OK.

99
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,000
So that is working in the very nature we what we're trying to do what we are going to do is we're going

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,130
to subscribe the user to our plan using Orphic subscribe method and then we going to assert that these

101
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,120
days actually go the speech and he can watch it.

102
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:47,760
OK.

103
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,480
So thank you so much and see you then.
