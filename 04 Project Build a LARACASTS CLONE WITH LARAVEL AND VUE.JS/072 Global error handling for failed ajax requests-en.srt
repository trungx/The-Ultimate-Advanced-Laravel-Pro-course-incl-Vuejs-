1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,210
Let's do a little bit something about our handling of our topic issue right now for example when we

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,060
make that exist request to delete a lesson right here we just cancel that lock.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,140
Let's make that better.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,690
Now we need to know the person we are building for.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,020
We are building for an administrator that's going to be adding series to a dashboard.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,240
So probably is going to be a developer so I'm not going to stress much about displaying some sort of

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,020
error or to make him know what to do because it's not going to be a regular user it's going to be a

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,770
developer.

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,400
Yes.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,250
Probably the owner off the site.

11
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:37,890
So what we want to do is to correct the error code so we're going to check if the statute is a 42 means

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,190
it's a validation error.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,880
And then we are going to show the user.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,340
But then if it's another form to then it's probably a problem of Beaufoy zation or an ex-pat CSR we

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,250
have to kill or 500 so we're just going to tell the user please there was an error on the server.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,090
Please refresh your page so that you get fresh data and then you start making the correct API calls.

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,660
OK.

18
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,180
So how do we handle this.

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:07,220
So here we'll just see if response does the response and maybe we should change this into error so our

20
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,610
a response.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,140
For starters because 4:22 then we're simply going to notify the user or he's validation was off.

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,750
So we'd have a window that note the method we created and the type is going to be danger and the message

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,090
screen to be had for Ed..

24
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,220
It's frustrating frocking.

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,400
And we actually might never hit this point because we are making sure that our validation is valid from

26
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,280
our front end.

27
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:43,800
So we are not sending any data from VGX but it just helps to know that we can do that then we're going

28
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:50,880
to see if this actually does not notify then that means we have a 500 here or for one then what we are

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,350
going to do is simply notify the user.

30
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,330
Something when you are on.

31
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,560
Please refresh please.

32
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,110
OK.

33
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,600
So this is going to be type of danger and we're going to move this console a lot right here.

34
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,020
OK.

35
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,770
So if there is just a school of watching to then you should try the user search.

36
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,000
And then if it wasn't a fortune E-2 means not validation error.

37
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,080
This is what we're going to tell the user.

38
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:13,840
OK.

39
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,450
So this is how we're going to be handling the airforce and we can actually build veejays front end in

40
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,360
such a way that it's never going to send wrong data to the server.

41
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,010
And probably the only areas that we're going to be getting are 500 million or so.

42
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:34,080
We just had a request for some reason but it's always good to handle for us and we have that's called

43
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,790
Reach on the back end to make sure that it actually works perfectly.

44
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,270
So what do we do.

45
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,590
Do we copy this exact thing.

46
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:49,540
Everywhere we have a console that lock like in the create lesson the view right here and paste this

47
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,690
in because this is what we want right.

48
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,350
So this is going to be everywhere.

49
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,990
And we'll get those forms and statues and do exactly the same thing and same thing right here.

50
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,080
Right.

51
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,100
So it gets in the air or after the EPA request checking if it's unfortunate too.

52
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,770
And if it's not performing to then we simply tell the user to refresh the speech.

53
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,430
So is this what we're going to be doing.

54
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,840
I think we should actually hide this functionality behind a blue bar method.

55
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,490
OK.

56
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:23,190
So ahead of what's in my app that jazz and I'm simply going to create a global error handler so window

57
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,050
door handle all the because function.

58
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,200
And this is what we want to do.

59
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,370
Therefore we want to parse into this My thought is the error that it's trying to handle.

60
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:32,820
OK.

61
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,000
So in the Arrow and then the method is going to take care of the rest.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,050
Therefore now that we have this eval we can headbutts or quick lessons and rather than doing this we

63
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:50,070
can pool all of this out and right we know the tendu error us on passing the error and sure enough we

64
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,690
have to catch the roll right here.

65
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,300
OK.

66
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,490
So we simply handled or using that like Lubo error handler.

67
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,940
So pull all this and paste that handle or mid-thought right there.

68
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,970
But we should probably do exactly the same thing in our lessons to see if we catch an error or simply

69
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,740
call for her to undo the error.

70
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,590
So I think that safer error handling in the next video we're going to start actually doing a complete

71
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:19,320
refracts or cleaning up features before we actually move on to our next step.
