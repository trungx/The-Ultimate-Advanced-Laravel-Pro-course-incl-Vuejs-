<p><strong>Section 1: </strong>The first section of this course covers advanced laravel customization tricks. You will learn how to use the best that the framework has to offer, by diving deep into some core concepts, and creating practical example apps to see how these concepts work.</p>





<p>This section will be updated in the future with a deep dive into more core concepts. So feel free to leave a request in the forum to request for new concepts to be covered.</p>





<p><strong>Section 2:</strong> This section covers <strong>TESTING LARAVEL APPLICATIONS</strong> , and <strong>TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUES . </strong>This section gives a basic introduction into testing laravel applications, and is not required to proceed with the other sections. If you have the basics of testing laravel applications, you can skip this section altogether, even though I highly recommend going through it, because in almost every lesson, I go into the Laravel core code to explain some laravel concepts further. This section is complete, and might only be updated with different Laravel version releases.</p>





<p><br></p>





<p><strong>Section 3</strong>: This section  is the  SAAS project, and would be the practical step by step guide to building a production ready LARACASTS clone. We would build around the stripe api, use Laravel cashier, and of course, Vuejs. This section is open for updates, and you are free to suggest new features to be added to the SAAS application as time goes on. Here's a live preview of the already deployed application: <a href="https://udemy.bahdcasts.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">UDEMY COURSE SAAS APP</a></p>





<p><strong>Section 4</strong>: This section covers deployment of laravel applications to the cloud. We would be deploying to Laravel forge, and I would explain exactly why in the lessons. This section is also open for updates, depending on the different problems you, and other students might face during deployment.</p>
