1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,280
We don't want any use that should be able to create post but only authenticated use us.

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,570
But before we write test for that what are we going to do is actually write some validation test for

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:17,600
creating Borst So we are going to be writing tests to make sure that a title must be required to create

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
a post on a body must also be required.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,470
So let's go ahead and create that public function test.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,560
Title is required to create most.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,160
So how are we going to do this.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,240
We are going to send a request to that and point but we're not going to pass in a title so we're going

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:39,470
to said the title to no and then we are going to assert that the session has arrows.

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,910
And one of those arrows is going to be title.

11
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,500
Right.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:50,600
So in our test response that BHB we have these asserts session has errors because remember we feel a

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,820
validation feel in Lovelle it's going to redirect the use of block or thematically and it's going to

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,690
set some sesshin keys containing the rendition areas that we have.

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,080
So let's go ahead and assert this.

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:09,860
So we're going to see response asserts session has errors and we're going to pass in the title as a

17
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,510
key.

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,220
OK.

19
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,310
So if you make a request to that end point without the title it should give us an error in the session.

20
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:26,900
So let's run this test independently by giving it a go and is going to be title we quiet is the name

21
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,740
of our group.

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:36,980
That's how the term you know one that we title we quiet as a group and we haven't seen in take constrained

23
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,430
volition not no constraint field on post title.

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:40,970
OK.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,720
So this is coming from our database saying that the first is not supposed to be null.

26
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,260
But then we give you all.

27
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:54,110
So what we're going to do is actually mirror that error a little bit by going to a clipboard stable

28
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,380
and then we're going to meet that error by making this an off label.

29
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,780
And this is just going to help us actually drive our validation.

30
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,240
So let's run that again.

31
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:09,980
And then we have session is missing expected key areas because if we had the words on what test response

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,550
first of all our role for them are checks if there's a key for cross and then it starts checking if

33
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,130
the error has the title key right.

34
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,160
And so that's because we don't even have any validation at all.

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,660
So let's head over to our controller and here again to validate the data that is being passed in.

36
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:35,740
So this validates we're going to take in the session and we're going to pass in an array of our nation

37
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,670
laws.

38
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:43,280
So first of all I'm just going to create available here for a session and then our request radiation

39
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,140
was sayto must be required.

40
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,540
OK so now that we have this validation rule for what it's all let's run that test again.

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,440
And really we have a validation exception that is foreign and that Videsh an exception is thrown because

42
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,210
in our handler we are twinn the exception that's uncommented a little bit.

43
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,380
And check out that and obviously we have a successful test.

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,770
Now let's wait exactly the same test for our body in our quick post-test.

45
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,030
So I'm just going to duplicate all of this.

46
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,790
And here is going to be body required for a good name.

47
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,710
And I'm just going to quit this too.

48
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,350
Body is required to quit posting.

49
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:30,090
And here we're going to have new post-Idol and this time around the body is going to be normal and we

50
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,230
are going to assert that assertion has the body aasan.

51
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,820
So let's run that test.

52
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:45,440
And this is going to be body quiet for a surgeon that has key areas because the radiation is just passing.

53
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,000
So we said that body required run that again.

54
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,910
And we have a successful test but let's not forget in our create stable we want to move this low level

55
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,880
flight that we used to test to make sure that the test give us expected.

56
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,440
So everything works perfectly.

57
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,860
Let's run everything in a suit and we have all successful responses.
