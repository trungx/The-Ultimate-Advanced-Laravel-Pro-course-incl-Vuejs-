1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,580
Access to this person successfully but it's not really application friendly it's not going to kill well.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,670
When we start building and adding more features for example in the web the HP we have closer's right

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:11,880
here.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,160
And what if we had to perform like 15 auctions before actually returning a view what were we going to

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,190
do in that case.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,600
So what are going to be doing is simply refactoring this code to a controller.

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:27,210
And remember our refactoring says we're just going to refactor all sets and make sure that we still

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,890
get green at the end of everything.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:29,300
All right.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,070
So I'm going to stretch this out with a pulse Quantrell on that.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,900
I wan to exist which doesn't exist yet and this is going to be the index method which is going to take

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,240
care of returning a post to us.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,560
Right.

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,640
So let's run our test now and see what we get.

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,500
And we have an error post control that does not exist.

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:55,090
Let's create a controller BHP Arsen mic control control controller created.

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,450
Let's run not just again.

18
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,950
And then we haven't ever seen the method index does not exist.

19
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,840
That's how the rods or to create the index method.

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,580
Not test again and then we have filled such in an empty string contains a symbol to Ardo.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,020
We've gone to this level and we know how to fix it.

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,130
We just need to find the post and return the view with the data.

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:14,560
Right.

24
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:21,810
So I'm just going to use the post class right here and then right here I can just return a view and

25
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,180
this view is opposed.

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:30,690
And this is with post and I'm going to find a post in here using the ID that was passed on the vision

27
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,920
we need to receive that ID right.

28
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,530
OK.

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,970
So find a post which have you read that post data.

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,290
That's one test.

31
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,330
Now we're done with our refactoring.

32
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,580
Hopefully everything works perfectly as it used to do before we started refactor.

33
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,560
OK perfect.

34
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,810
Everything works good enough.
