1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,210
Why don't we write another lab or dusk test to make sure that only an authenticated user can naturally

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,100
create a pause.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,410
Right.

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,170
So if I use a trice viscid this endpoint he's redirect that's the logging page.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,350
So let's think of that.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,970
I'll just copy every single thing in this test just to save some time.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,230
Paste this right here.

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,700
Says the user can create post.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,610
No need to create a user because we want to make sure the user is not authenticated.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,490
We're not going to be logging the user in then we're going to visit this route and we're not going to

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,290
be asserting any of this.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,020
We're going to simply see a certain path IISS slash logging.

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:41,600
Right.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,210
So I'm just going to pull this off and we have what's asked.

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,230
Revisit that page.

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,560
I said that it is slash logging simple.

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:01:00,690
So let's create a group so we can run this stairs individually and we'll see create host of whatever

18
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,310
name you want to give right.

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,090
So that's one quick post off the group Yikes.

20
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,870
And we have a figure saying filled searching that's two strings are equal because the use of words to

21
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,350
redirect that to this page and he actually quit the post-white.

22
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:24,600
So let's head over to our Web PH BE and see how we could fix this so we could simply attach a middleware

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:33,180
of auth to this route to make sure that only the authenticated user can visit this and point.

24
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:33,650
Right.

25
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,900
So let's go ahead and run this again.

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,210
Awesome.

27
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,360
We have a successful test.

28
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,970
So any person trying to visit this route must be authenticated on why we're here.

29
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:58,330
We could really just protect the post side of the road to make sure that only authenticated users are

30
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,530
truly make a request to this end point.
