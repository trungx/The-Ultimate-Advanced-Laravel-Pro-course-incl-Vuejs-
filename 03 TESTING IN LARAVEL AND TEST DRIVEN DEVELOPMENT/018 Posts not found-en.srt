1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,700
Looking at the code right now it looks pretty unknown.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,260
But then what happens when a user tries to visit a route that does not exist.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,200
For example passing in an ID of a post that doesn't exist.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,580
We don't want to just ban an error message in production right.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,830
So that's why this is a good test of this.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,110
So will your view of block post test and Reagan to write a new test and this is going to be a public

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,270
function test views or for for speech when post.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,160
It's not fun when the post is not found we want to view of four or four page.

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,940
So let's take care of that.

10
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,660
First of all we need to take care of all of our interests and our actions.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:43,290
And obviously with our search staff but for our rings I think we want to visit a post that does not

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,440
exist and then assert that the status is forceful and also so that we see a particular type of string

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,660
on our screen our Ahrendts terp is not really going to cut the deal right here because we have nothing

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,660
to avenge for our actions.

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,490
We're going to be visiting about that does not exist or rather exist with the wrong parameters.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,560
And then for us to assert that we have a fall or fall so that we see some sort of takes on the screen.

17
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:14,400
So for action step we're going to see a response because this gets and we're going to go to the post

18
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,200
and point slash and we're going to see invalid ID right here.

19
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:19,630
OK.

20
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,470
Because this I.D. does not exist.

21
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:29,180
And then for assertions they're going to assert that the status of that request was a form of fraud.

22
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,500
So a substitute is a 4 0 4.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,780
And we're also going to assert that we have a text that is displayed.

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,000
So we're going to see a search see the page you are looking for cannot be found.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,950
So we have asked how do we want it.

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,510
So this brings us back to the idea of literally running our test we could actually run it the way we've

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,070
been running.

28
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,220
But then as you see as application Those are tests increase and we could have hundreds of tests at the

29
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,830
end of this exercise.

30
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:04,070
So we're going to introduce a very simple way to run our tests and that's going to be using groups and

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,720
it provides us with a lot a lot of ways to run the test.

32
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,920
And so I'm just going to use the easiest possible if we want to run only this particular test to see

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,190
if it works because we already know this one works.

34
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,450
Then what we could do is pass a good break here and we're just going to call these posts not fun.

35
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:26,850
So when we to come on we're going to pass in a good option and this is going to one only test that have

36
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,040
that particular group.

37
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,170
So let's get our heads or termino on one that Venda ph B unit and then begin to see who should be most

38
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,520
not found.

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,580
And now we have only that test running.

40
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,250
If you look at the top we have only one test and we have an error exception trying to get property of

41
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,960
an object in the post that bleed the PH P.

42
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,380
Right.

43
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,150
But this is not what we want.

44
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,050
Remember when you visit this route is going to still retain that view even if it doesn't find the post.

45
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:57,430
Right.

46
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,580
They're getting the trying to get parts of object because the law is returned to our view and this is

47
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,990
what we want to fix.

48
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,350
Right.

49
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,610
We want this to pass.

50
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,850
So the very simple way to fix this is to make sure that our controller pulls an exception when the post

51
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,750
is not found.

52
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,420
So I'm just going to cut this out and pass in a verbal portion right here and post two posts.

53
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,100
Fine.

54
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,250
But then we're not going to be using the find method anymore.

55
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,530
We're going to be using the fine of failed methods that level provides for us.

56
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,150
And this line of feel mid-thought is not for an exception if the post is not found.

57
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,990
It's not going to return to the view so let's run the test again.

58
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:42,140
And here we can see no results for be opposed invalid ID.

59
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,290
So model not found exception has been torn from us.

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,250
So this is the exception that we want to try and cut right here.

61
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,750
And if we catch that exception we're going to be 24:4 ph rather than a post ph.

62
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:01,740
So let's wrap this in a try catch block and then catch and we're going to be catching the illuminates

63
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,340
database eloquent moment found exception.

64
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,190
So which would be exactly what we have here.

65
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:15,670
The Queen Mother non-fun exception was this exception any time he doesn't find that database record

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,440
using the final fill method.

67
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:17,810
OK.

68
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,130
So what do we want to happen when we catch this exception.

69
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:28,050
We are simply going to see return of view which is to fall or fall that need to be and we're going to

70
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,250
be setting that up.

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:35,500
So let's run that test again and see what we have the view for for not found so far.

72
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,960
And I'm just going to create a forum for the lead ph be.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,060
Let's run that again.

74
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:40,970
Now we received this.

75
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:49,230
Ever seen that we expected for 200 obviously because actually returning a fall for the lady is a successful

76
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,700
response.

77
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,240
Right.

78
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:57,080
So how do we convert this to a failed response with Lavoe writes us with a very helpful abought method

79
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,290
and what it does here is it's returns an ESPY responds with a particular message.

80
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,030
So we are seeing the return of forward response and the message right here is just going to be not fun

81
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,380
for example.

82
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,820
Right.

83
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,930
Let's run this and see what we get.

84
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:18,600
I'm sorry I needed to pull out this piece of code right here obviously so that this method can run right.

85
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,860
So let's run that again.

86
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,250
Now why are we receiving a not fun exception.

87
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:30,540
This is because Tesla receives the stutterers code and then it tries to respond by returning a four

88
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,270
or four page with the arrow.

89
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,830
So the 4:4 picture that it looks for is in a directory in the views right.

90
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,780
So it goes to the views and doesn't every tree and looks 24:4 for that data.

91
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,650
But then we don't have one.

92
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,640
That's why it's seen the page cannot be found.

93
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:52,190
So let's go ahead and try to fix this by creating our errors directory and then moving this fall further

94
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,930
into that fire.

95
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,930
OK done.

96
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,050
Most of for the better screen my air was a tree everything should wall everything should work perfectly

97
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,680
right now.

98
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,130
So let's check it out.

99
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,700
One that's asked how you receive exactly the same error.

100
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,030
Now why is this an open letter ph.

101
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,700
B We have to find that exception again means Lavo actually does not have a way to turn that into an

102
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,690
STV response.

103
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,500
Therefore when that gets in that view.

104
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,940
So I'm just going to commend this and then I'll run that.

105
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,400
And now we haven't ever seen for such an empty string contains the pitch you are looking for cannot

106
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,020
be found.

107
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,030
Now this makes more sense.

108
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,950
And remember we are simply an exception so that we have more help for I was forced to be able to work

109
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,330
with.

110
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,230
It's not a necessity at all for testing so you can't actually send it to production.

111
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,090
If not a lot of stuff are going to break.

112
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:50,390
OK so now for that we all we need to do is actually make sure we have this sentence in our view right

113
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,320
so it works.

114
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,290
So I'm just going to copy this plea from this page pasted right here.

115
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,100
The links.

116
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,890
I don't need that.

117
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,560
And to be exact.

118
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,840
I'm going ahead of to my view a blog post and then I'm going to copy this sentence head over to my full

119
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,710
4 and replace the lovely sentence with this.

120
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,090
Run my test again and now we have a successful response.
