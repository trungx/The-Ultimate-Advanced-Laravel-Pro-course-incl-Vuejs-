1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:07,490
Another test I want us to write is Vistula post-speech clicking on a particular post link and then actually

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,610
viewing the post right.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,260
So let's go ahead and write that public function test.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:18,700
A user can view our post and we can do almost exactly the same thing when I get a factory.

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:24,470
But the structure is going to be for the posts that we want to view and he's going to use the post class

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,970
that's just in the post-blast at the top.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,410
Then we need to get him a boxing stance and in the callback.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,370
We're not going to be visiting this page.

9
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,920
And men are going to be passing the user or going to in the post and right here will visit the post

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:48,420
page and then would click a link and this link is going to be the view posts GITTOES.

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,220
And then after clicking that link will first of all a search that the past is the past to view this

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:05,030
particular post which is post slash Nepos ID and then just assert that we see the Ditto's for that post

13
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,480
even though we've already covered this in our test coverage.

14
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:15,920
Let's just say we assert that we see the post title and assert that we see the contents body and also

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:23,380
Ostrow that we see that these supposed creator that using are helpful methods that we create up.

16
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,450
And that's pretty much it.

17
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,880
Let's just give this a group and run it.

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,360
And this is going to be both.

19
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,700
Page right.

20
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,350
Let's just give it the group.

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:48,530
And then we run it by saying ph we are San dusk and the group is post page.

22
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:54,610
Now it points out to us the error we are having which says we cannot read pop actually property of undefine

23
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,060
meaning we don't actually have that link that we are trying to click right.

24
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,500
So when you write tests like this and we head over to.

25
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,980
So when we write just like this and we now see that we don't have that link.

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,680
One of the great advantages is in case you want to switch out your theme that see you want your website

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,850
to have a new theme and you want to bring in a new theme and you replace every single view you can just

28
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,660
simply want all of this automated says to make sure that everything works the same.

29
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,240
Making sure that you haven't changed the way that works towards making sure that the linkage actually

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,600
view the post is still available.

31
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,720
A lot of that stuff.

32
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,730
So let's go ahead and simply create a link such that when the browser tries to click that link it's

33
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,350
going to view it.

34
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,850
Right.

35
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,980
So helmets are post that only the Ph be.

36
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,300
And right here in the For Each loop we want to generate a link for each of our posts right.

37
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,120
So I'm just going to paste in that post that takes their view post GITTOES and this is what the process

38
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,210
is going to look for.

39
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,540
And then I'm gonna specify that it should go to the slushed post route.

40
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,680
And pressing the post ID as simple as that.

41
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,140
Awesome.

42
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,070
So let's run our test again to see what we get.

43
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,270
And we have a successful test.
