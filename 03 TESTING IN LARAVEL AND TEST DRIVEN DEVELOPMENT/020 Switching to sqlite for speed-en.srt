1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,490
One little thing I want to talk about is the database we are using right now we are using my skill for

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,050
our test.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,160
And that's not the best choice for our test because it takes some time for us structurally safe a record

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,540
to our database which is on the hard disk.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,770
And then we try that data before our test is completed.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:29,130
So if I run a test shoot right now everything we can see it takes almost six seconds to run.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,650
But then what I'm going to do is actually switch up switch to a data base that we are using for a test

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,870
and I'm going to use my skill light.

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,980
So first of all let me just create a Maskil like database and I'm just going to college testing that.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,220
Q All right.

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,160
And I'm going to see it in my database directory.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,280
So touch database slash Destino that's going right.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,850
And sure enough in the what is the real tree.

14
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,530
We should have testing that skill like created for us.

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:04,830
Now how do we tol'able to use unless it's a beast which is much lighter much faster than my skill because

16
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,060
it works in memory rather than using the default that it's using.

17
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,150
So how do we tell Lavoe to actually use a secure light which is much faster and better for testing rather

18
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,720
than using my skill.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,500
Let's head over to our database the Ph.D. and right here let's check out our connections.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,930
We have the Escola connection which is database or that's called like we change the connection to testing

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,470
that's light and the mice go connection is already set.

22
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:40,110
So we're going to be telling the HP unit in particular to use this database connection rather than using

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,100
this one.

24
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,780
So let's go to HP unit ex-MIL.

25
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:51,480
And what are we going to do right here is create a new environment variable and this file is simply

26
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,310
a configuration for PH P unit.

27
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,530
So a lot of boilerplate is putting right here for us by Lavo.

28
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,550
But let's not really care about that.

29
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:07,320
Let's just go ahead and create an environment variable that is going to set the database to use so G-B

30
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,700
connection like we said we want to use a secure line for testing.

31
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:21,570
And the last thing we need to pass it is D-B database and we're going to see the database should be

32
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,510
in memory.

33
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,830
So that's it for configuration.

34
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:33,390
Let's try now to run our test and we can see the amount of speed that we gain just by changing our database

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,380
driver.

36
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:44,160
So first of all we were using my skill connection if I change this to my skill and cut this out we can

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,070
see that it took almost four seconds.

38
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,400
It took more than four seconds to actually run our test.

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,270
But if I change this much as light and use an in-memory database we can see the amount of time that

40
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,040
is saved.

41
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,020
So it's really really fast.

42
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,790
The difference is outstanding.

43
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,890
And by the time you're writing applications that have about 100 to 200 test this is going to really

44
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:14,100
be very helpful because you don't want to send your code to a developer and he takes hours upon hours

45
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,900
to test your code.

46
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,270
OK.

47
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,050
So this is as it's not even after half a second and it's perfect for testing.
