1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,760
Let's talk about service providers.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,690
No this is one of the coffee yourself Lavoe and I think its importance comes immediately after the importance

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,580
of the application that be in Lavoe Lamma provides a great deal of customization using service providers.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,010
And this is truly a space Ostrum be able to do whatever we want to do.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,710
As soon as the application is booter.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,850
So let's have a watch or service provider.

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,400
Now also provide us access and phone support service provider and they might or might not implement

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,380
this boat and registar methods.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,230
Now let's talk a little bit about the difference between these two during the boot process.

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,280
Loveall registar its service providers and the service providers are the ones that are registered in

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,510
the can be Abda.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,870
So right here it's going to go to the provide the army and when you each and every one of these providers.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
How does it do that.

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,460
It goes through each and every one of those service providers and he calls the Register method.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,640
So for example if we choose any of the providers for example the precursory will light up we can see

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,180
each Register method and basically what it does is it stream the money Jayanta the content or the contract

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,420
into the container area the manager and the factory and all of that good stuff.

18
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:08,890
OK.

19
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,880
Lavoe doing its boot sequence is going to call only the registar method on each and every one of the

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,900
providers that I specified in the app that HP provide us away.

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:26,810
Next thing after the process has been completed its now when to call the boots method on each and every

22
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,440
one of those providers.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,850
Therefore this broadcast service provider can have a book metod.

24
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,660
And this is going to be called by Lavoe after the application has been booted.

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,930
So after Illuminatus finished running.

26
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,370
So if you have a service provider like the US-Soviet provider that is empty and provided to us by Lavo

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,120
if you weren't buying anything of the container registar My thought is where you're going to do it.

28
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,590
OK.

29
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:55,770
So put things into the container in the register mid-thought but never try to get things out of the

30
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,650
container because remember the Register method is called when loveall is still in the process of registering

31
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,630
service providers.

32
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,230
Therefore you might be getting something out of the container or it's not yet been put into the onto

33
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,060
or by Lovelle.

34
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,490
OK.

35
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,070
So make sure you're only putting it into the container in the register provider.

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,010
So for you to see this revisit what ever provider by Lovelle for example the database server provider

37
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,180
it's only going to be doing registration.

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,820
OK that's all it's going to do.

39
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,300
It's never going to try to get something out of the container.

40
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,500
If you check out the first system service provider and you also go through each region stomack thought

41
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,190
it is putting things into the container.

42
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,690
OK.

43
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,520
Registering things into the container.

44
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,430
It's not getting anything out.

45
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,710
So if you have customer service providers or you want to use service providers like our service provider

46
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,940
make sure you're not getting things out of the container here but you're putting things in.

47
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,120
And then once lobert is completely set it's going to cost each and every Booch method of each and every

48
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,960
provider.

49
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,690
So for example this is where you can maybe get an out of the container or the database or whatever you

50
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,200
want to get out of the container.

51
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:08,280
OK so but my thought after Lavoe husband Richard thumb I thought during the registration process of

52
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,500
Lovelle registering the service providers.

53
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,080
OK.

54
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,860
Now how could we use a service provider.

55
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,290
Remember we have the odd vaults mid-thought.

56
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,930
I'm going to use this as an example.

57
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,980
So right here we have this odd thought and like we saw in our forsakes us it's calling to offer him

58
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,740
a thought in the vaults are the Ph be.

59
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,780
And what often thought is doing is simply registering some votes.

60
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,270
Right.

61
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,150
So this is one of the things we can do in our service provider.

62
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,570
We can register a new route.

63
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,490
For example if we dont want to dynamically or put those routes in the weather THP or if those regions

64
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:48,510
routes are supposed to be registered only after a condition is met then the service provider is a very

65
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,040
good place to go.

66
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,370
We also have a voucher provider that will provide for us.

67
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,550
So if it has anything to do with routes then you can do it in the boot method of the vaults of each

68
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,510
provider if it has anything to do with broadcasting.

69
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,100
Then maybe the podcast available writer is a good place to register.

70
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,720
For example the book Kasserine provider actually registers some routes in its Meffert.

71
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,510
OK just like we're talking about.

72
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,340
So why don't we have some form with service providers to see how we can actually generate our own and

73
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,210
customize it however we like.

74
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,760
I'm going to create a new provider.

75
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,400
Peachtree Arsen make provider and most of the time when you're creating a new provider it would be because

76
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,260
you want to handle a particular thing in your application.

77
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,620
So let's say we want to communicate with our medium API and we need to obviously pulling the tree clients.

78
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:41,040
So here it is squarehead and one composer require this and then looks like for us to use this we need

79
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,230
a new instance of the middle class and we need to pass in these conventions.

80
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,100
So where is the best place for us to put this.

81
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,650
The controller might be a first place to start but then every time you want to use medium you're going

82
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,090
to see a new medium which is not bad but then emerging.

83
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,440
Of this class of multiple times over and over and your application Meanwhile you can just all Lavoe

84
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,400
to give it to you.

85
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,570
So the best place to put this would be into a secret service provider or you can also put it in the

86
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,280
observational either but just so we learn how to create our own service providers.

87
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,340
We can create a medium service provider plus indiscreet and shelves all over any time we want an instance

88
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,410
of medium though this and give it to us.

89
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:19,880
OK.

90
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,940
Let's go ahead and do that make provide medium service provider.

91
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,320
Now that's great for us.

92
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:29,980
If we had a virtual app there to provide us we have these medium service provider that has been created

93
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,530
for us.

94
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,700
And remember our book mid-thought is after our registration and our register method is doing registration.

95
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,510
Therefore what we can do is buying something into the container.

96
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:46,400
So by is simply telling Lavoe take this on for us whenever we want it give it back to us OK.

97
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:52,450
We want to store an instance of medium in our container and we want Lavo to give it to us every time

98
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:57,720
we need it rather than creating a new instance like 10 times in our control.

99
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,990
So Ali dishcloths so use this glass right here and during the registration process and when I told.

100
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,700
OK since you are registering things and you're calling these registar methode for my medical service

101
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:17,030
provider please keep a major pitch be as DK and what you're going to be keeping is an instance of major.

102
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,430
And we need to pass in the credentials.

103
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:19,940
OK.

104
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,330
Because for instance this loss we need some credentials.

105
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,020
And naturally if you type Hynds this in any control of our dependency indiction Lovelle would understand

106
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,230
that.

107
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,040
But then if you're putting in some predations then you need to talk about how to bind this into the

108
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,850
container.

109
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,750
And what we are doing here with team level whenever we ask for these key Give us this.

110
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,360
And how do we get our credentials since we learned in the last lesson that we can actually have a lower

111
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,190
cost configuration files.

112
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,770
Let's create a new config file just for our medium API.

113
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,470
So fix Losh made you appear to be.

114
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,790
And right here we just need to return an array right.

115
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:01,050
So return and I'm going to copy these configurations away from this page and I'm going to be studying.

116
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:01,680
OK.

117
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,340
So this is the configuration.

118
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,700
And you can go ahead and use.

119
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,080
Ian wiitwd you get this form that the NV file if you wish.

120
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:12,750
And in your service provider you just need to call config right.

121
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,740
So config.

122
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,640
Get rid of them and that's it.

123
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,920
It's going to give us whatever is returned from that medium to we file.

124
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,520
OK.

125
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,840
So we are putting the configuration we are selling novel every time we need mid-June.

126
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,080
Just give us a new instance with this configuration.

127
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,930
Now during the boot process squinched rigid studies.

128
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,080
And every time an application where we need this level is going to give it to us let's go ahead and

129
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,700
request this in our web ph and see what we get.

130
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,540
That's died down.

131
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,010
I will call it a resolve help on my father level gives us.

132
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,520
And this is simply to enable that thing that we put into the container with this name.

133
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,870
We want it right now.

134
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,510
OK.

135
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,530
So we can see it in a very well.

136
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:58,070
Let me just show you right here so we can see in stands of medium equals resolve.

137
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,990
This from the county you know.

138
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,500
So this is the instance of major ones.

139
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,660
And then let's die down that stands right here.

140
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,560
So if I refresh my home page yeah we get an error.

141
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:15,190
And I think you should know why we get this error because we've created our service provider but we

142
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,400
haven't told Lavo to load this service provider right.

143
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,330
So for us it's all our vote.

144
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,020
This is one of the service providers we want you to load.

145
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,420
We need to have a watch or a configuration file until Lavo when you log in so people write us.

146
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,580
Make sure you load the medium service provider.

147
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,090
OK.

148
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,510
So quick refresh again.

149
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,260
There we go.

150
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,590
We have an instance of me do this.

151
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:42,430
It's also Lavoe to also boot or call the Register method and the register mid-thought binds that key

152
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,660
to our container.

153
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,510
And this is the instance that we are asking for in our web ph.

154
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,070
Now what can we do in the boot method.

155
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,170
Like I said the Bush method is after everything has happened.

156
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,550
Therefore we can't ask for anything from the container.

157
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,950
For example in this case let's call it a container and ask for Duvall's up.

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,180
And this actually is the currency in our application which extends to currency you know and it's actually

159
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,550
saved us on our property on our service provider.

160
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:10,980
OK.

161
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,810
So this album make lots of simply means to get the router or you can actually use the resolve method

162
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,270
that we're using in the web that we.

163
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,550
And since we have a router sure enough we have to get Mithal and we can define or get mid-thought to

164
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:31,210
define a new route and we can see this new is for me June and we can pass in a closure to be executed

165
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,560
when we visit that vault.

166
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,680
So let's just return made you home for example a stream.

167
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,360
OK.

168
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,940
So we just start a new route in a boot method.

169
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,420
Now let's reset that home.

170
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,720
So minge you and sure enough we have medium home therefore just in a nutshell we can see that level

171
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,790
provides us a really easy way to hook into the system by creating service providers.

172
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,480
So you can customize a lot of things.

173
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,830
For example you can even replace the router in a custom World Service it you can replace the podcasting

174
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:08,370
driver if you want to implement your own just by creating a service provider and binding a key and every

175
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,560
time Lavoe is requested for their kids to return whatever is in the closure so we can see how Lavoe

176
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,400
gives us really easy customization and service providers.

177
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,620
We have a bunch more thought of register mid-thought we can register whatever we want to register into

178
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:28,690
the container and in our boots thought whatever we want to do maybe send an email when the particular

179
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,440
wallet is visited or do whatever we want.

180
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,500
We can do that in the boot method.

181
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,010
OK so that's how we play along with service providers to customize Lavoe.
