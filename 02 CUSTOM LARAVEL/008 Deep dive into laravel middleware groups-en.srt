1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,030
Let's talk about middleway groups like Chrisette middleware groups are simply middleway that run on

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,980
a particular set of routes.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:14,460
OK so you can define a route and you can make sure that vote belongs to a group of other routes and

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,780
then you can one particular middleware on all of that group of wealths.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,770
For example if I take it your web Dogpatch be you can register a route group in a close vote and inside

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,890
this group you can go ahead and define routes of particular similarity and dissimilarity can be a prefix

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,880
that you want to put in and you can use the Lovell's prefix mid-thought or you can once attach a middleware

8
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:45,030
to all of these routes and you can also use the Lavoe me to when my thought love gives us this extensibility

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,550
therefore you can create your own Castano middleware groups that we are going to be talking about in

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,710
this video loveall ships in which to do for me to wear groups and in our Kanada ph we we can see those

11
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,270
groups.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,670
The first is the Web Globe and The second is the API group the web middleware is applied to all vowels

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,830
in the group called weap which are the routes that are registered in the web that should be and the

14
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,330
API group is applied to all routes in a group called API which are those in the API that Ph be.

15
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,700
And I'm going to show you how this happens if you head over to our World Service Provider.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,460
We discover that we have a map mid-thought And this map mid-thought registrars some routes for us because

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,610
the map API WILESMITH thought and the map where Prout's method and recheck the map worthwhile.

18
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:36,570
I thought what it does is it registers some routes and what precisely and it imports all of the worlds

19
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:43,290
from web that we register them and make sure that it applies a namespace of this namespace which is

20
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:43,780
here.

21
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,560
So up S2P control us.

22
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,650
And also it wraps all of those routes in Amida where weap.

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,460
OK.

24
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,510
So the middleware group is called WEP and it wraps all of the routes in the web the PH BE WITH THIS

25
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,350
middleware.

26
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,690
Same thing with the API Roths.

27
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:07,590
It really starts a group force in all of the valves from API ph sets a namespace which is this namespace

28
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,220
and applies the middleware API group on that group of routes.

29
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:11,630
OK.

30
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,880
And it also prefixes API right.

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,790
So if you actually want that to customize what is the prefix right here.

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,740
You can change it to whatever you want.

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,600
OK so maybe API version one or to whatever you want.

34
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,490
OK then you can also customize the namespace of all your API calls.

35
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,700
For example if you want that every single vote that is in the API that we talk to automatically get

36
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,780
control us from an API directory.

37
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,350
All you need to do is apply slash API right here and rather than at SGP control as it's going to go

38
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,540
up it's to be control us API directory.

39
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,310
OK how cool is that level gives us a very large possibility to customize even at this level.

40
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,160
Now let's talk about something fun.

41
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,060
How do we create our own group.

42
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,200
We just start with our own middleware and how do we change everything together.

43
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,900
Let's do that access right now.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,180
Say you have a group of administrators in your application and you want administrators to see a particular

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,350
page or a particular action button and you don't want no administrators to be able to see this.

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,520
How do you change that up.

47
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,440
Let's quit accustom me to where for this khichri arson make me aware administrates up and this is a

48
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,660
functionality that you might have in almost all of your applications.

49
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:31,080
So let's go ahead and build it I'll head over to the administrator of the Ph.D. and now in this middleware

50
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,080
what we're going to be doing is checking if the current user is an administrator so if not we'll do

51
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,580
something.

52
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,460
And if they use an administrator we'll do something else.

53
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,860
OK so.

54
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:48,510
So looks like we need a user base of education system would make this fast with Peachtree or sun make

55
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,020
us.

56
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:49,830
And that's it.

57
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,350
You have an indication system for us.

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,930
Now what are we going to be doing this me the way.

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,390
Like we discussed in the previous videos we can't actually create with an administrator or table or

60
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,780
an admin Boullion field in our users table to deploy I mean if they use Eisenman is.

61
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,880
But if you have a very simple application where you have only one or two administrators the best way

62
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,890
to go is to civil administrator e-mails in and away in your configuration file.

63
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,850
Very easy.

64
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,420
And then in your middle where you just need to check if the current user is an administrator.

65
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,980
I will show you how I do this in my Abdur ph be able to find a custom rakli which is going to be for

66
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,070
the administrators of this application.

67
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,920
And what I'm simply going to be doing is actually saving the emails.

68
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:42,170
So right here I'm going to see administrators and all this to an array and or pictures in country at

69
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,800
France the comb as the only administrator.

70
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,280
OK.

71
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,210
So any administrators in your location will be registered on that is key.

72
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:58,500
Then in my administration aware what I'm suddenly going to do is check if in a way of user email and

73
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,430
we're checking if it's in the of config mid-thought and we'll get the app that administrators.

74
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,020
OK.

75
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,580
So if it's in that RV then let's just for the moment die down.

76
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,300
You are an administrator.

77
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,970
OK.

78
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,800
Then if the user is not an administrator then would down.

79
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,440
You do not have access.

80
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:18,810
OK.

81
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,640
So that's what I mean the where does it checks if the Korean user is an administrator or by checking

82
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,340
if his email is among the ones that are registered in our config Abdur administrators.

83
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:35,430
OK then what we could do right here is make sure that the user is authenticated by saying if Jack then

84
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,530
run days and else would date them slogan.

85
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,160
OK.

86
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,540
So check if they use this authenticator.

87
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,560
If not they don't place logging.

88
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:49,670
But if they use ice authenticates a check if his email is in the config array of administrators.

89
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,870
And if that is the case Didymos you're an administrator.

90
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,300
If not then they don't.

91
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,060
You do not have access.

92
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,410
Now whether we register our middle.

93
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,750
Let's head over to Iraq in order Ph we like we said we want to quit our own middleware group that is

94
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,300
going to have all the valves really start for administrators therefore let's go ahead and take care

95
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,110
of this right in this group we are going to create our own group and I'll call that mean for now and

96
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,420
in here we need to really stop all the middleware that are going to be wrong for this group of words.

97
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,950
First of all I would like to pulling all the Middle Way to start.

98
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:30,990
On the other where because we are going to be using cookies starting the slash checking the CSR if token

99
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,610
sharing arose from session and all of that good stuff.

100
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,220
OK.

101
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,840
And then we want to also really start what costs are made aware right here.

102
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:43,110
So up at TGP middleware and that will be administrates our class.

103
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,770
That's it.

104
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,250
So we start a new admin middleware group and uses all the middleware groups in Web.

105
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,490
And it also has a custom administrates all the way.

106
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,400
Now if we head over to our Web page be we can do something like this.

107
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:03,420
It's a group and everything inside here is going to be for the administrators and we can map middleware

108
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,920
and we'll pass in Middleware group right here which is going to be at me that we just we just start

109
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:14,420
right now and we can also add a prefix of maybe at mean and let's just try this out.

110
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:20,340
Let's really start a route which is going to be a get and I'll just register the home route and right

111
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,270
here we're just going to die.

112
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,990
Don't what was reached.

113
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,360
OK so.

114
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,880
So we have a router middleware group called admin or we just read you start and we are applying it to

115
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,480
this world group right here.

116
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,960
And we've prefixed all routes on that at vulgo using our admin key right here.

117
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,030
And therefore we have SLAs are being registered me to where right now.

118
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,060
And let's go ahead and try to visit it if we visit.

119
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,380
I mean yeah we have police log in let's visit luggin.

120
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:48,990
All right.

121
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,220
Registar so with when you start and you use up and by the way behind the scenes are ready to kind of

122
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,430
setting up my database and stuff like that.

123
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:55,900
OK.

124
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,270
And registering with the email that I specified as an administrator.

125
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,570
And yeah I'm locked in.

126
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,490
So let's reset.

127
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,380
Admin right now.

128
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,020
And it says you are an administrator.

129
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:11,460
OK if I head over to my config and I change this e-mail in some way such that this user is no longer

130
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,000
on the streets so sure enough we have the correct message that says you do not have access.

131
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,700
But if you look at say that terrorists or with that be you can see it.

132
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,310
It looks a little bit messy.

133
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,980
And if you have a thousand of hundred votes that are for the admin middleware group and stockinette

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,060
in Sika is really going to make your far too messy.

135
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,060
But we can do better.

136
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,460
Right.

137
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,640
Level has taught us how to customize.

138
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,780
So let's go ahead.

139
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,250
Lots of people write up and we are going to define our own routes group.

140
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,270
And this is going to be this map.

141
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,970
I mean WILESMITH.

142
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,160
OK let's just use the convention.

143
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,220
Now we need to create that method.

144
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,460
So protect it.

145
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,240
So how is this going to be with registar prefix just like we're doing right now.

146
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:02,690
And that refix would be admin and the middleware is going to be the mean middleware and the namespace.

147
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,580
Let's see if we want to control us to be in the admin directory so would concatenate this namespace

148
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:15,480
which is the default namespace to administrates us namespace and the group that we're going to specify

149
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,460
is from.

150
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,070
I mean that PH BE therefore in our route's directory slosh.

151
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,690
I mean that Peachtree.

152
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,090
OK so let's create the file routes.

153
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,930
Slash I mean that should be OK.

154
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,790
So right here this is where we are going to define all of our routes.

155
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,830
Therefore this route that we have right here I'm going to pull it out and now it's going to be in our

156
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,200
administrates or the Peachtree farm.

157
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:41,910
OK.

158
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,930
Now we have a very clean space to really start all routes that have to do with administrators.

159
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,650
And if we were fresh We should have the same results.

160
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:58,150
We do therefore let's go ahead and make sure this user is an administrator or safe run that request.

161
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,440
And we still have exactly the same results.

162
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:00,870
OK.

163
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,740
So that's perfectly great.

164
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:10,150
We've learned how we can create our own custom middleware groups or our own custom routes fairs where

165
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,230
we can have king which start vaulting application.

166
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:21,310
So just a week up in Canada Ph.D. you start a new admin middleware group and we are registering all

167
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:27,980
of the middleware on the Web plus our own plus our own custom administrates or middleware.

168
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:34,090
Ponder this middleware group and in our overall service provider we have a new set of what's called

169
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,290
admin and we're going to place them in the Admin the pitch.

170
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,030
And we are applying that me to where to all of those routes in that group.

171
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,610
So hopefully you understood what we did in this lesson.

172
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,820
I hope it goes a long way to mega-projects to look clean and professional.

173
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,600
I'm going to catch you in the next video where we talk about something more fun.

174
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:52,620
Thank you.
