1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,850
Let's have a deep dive into lava's default authentication system and see how we can completely customize

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,680
it to our needs if need be Lavoe ships end with this son come on Peachtree or sun make off.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,480
And what this is going to do is come for a complete authentication system for us.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,030
It really comes with the default control us in our app controllers directory and we have an after a

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,450
tree that contains the controllers for these authentication system but that command is going to ship

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,080
in or publish some of views for authentication.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,220
And it's also going to register the routes.

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,770
Let's run this command and if we check out what there are true right now we have a new home controller.

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,310
And then in our resources there actually we have a new off directory where we have the registar password

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,870
resets views.

11
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,890
Now interestingly you know a Watchfire who had a watch went to BHB.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,080
We have a new route set that has been registered for us if we check this out and also to understand

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,890
what is going on we have a log in and just page and we can go ahead and we just start a new account.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,190
And by the way behind the scenes are naturally sets up my database and my grid that we choose my data

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:11,310
tray I have this database all the skill lights and then my dad in Wi-Fi and referencing the secure light

16
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,250
connection.

17
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:12,710
OK.

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,420
So let's reach out on your accounts and once that process we redirect redirected to the home page let's

19
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,590
go ahead and divide into this system to understand exactly what level is doing for us behind the scenes.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,150
First of all I'm going to start by checking out my loggin and registar buttons that are on the home

21
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,110
page now so resources will come the blade that should be closed down and right here we have an IF block

22
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:43,860
and this is checking if the route logging exists and if it exists then it's going to show us the home.

23
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:50,040
Now if the user has authenticated and it's going to show us logging in and we just type all if the user

24
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,710
is not authenticated and by the way this is a new blade directive that came in the late days of the

25
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,640
Apple iPhone 4.

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,530
How do we know this world is registar.

27
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,870
I mean why we don't have it.

28
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,920
Let's check out our Web the PSP.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,480
So we have this new routes that was placed right here by our son C'mon.

30
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,500
And we also have this one that was released.

31
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,810
I'd love to know the routes that have been registered in application level provides us with pecera Arsen

32
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:19,530
route list and we can see the routes that we have in our web that HP is responsible for all of these

33
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,130
routes that we see right here.

34
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,380
And of course that includes the logging route right here.

35
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,470
That's why you know Welkom that lead ph be.

36
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,690
We now have this if block displaying because we registered with the US command now issue head back to

37
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,310
Boston viscid the home page.

38
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:41,290
Sure enough we have him here because right now this is the part of this of check that is successful.

39
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,390
That's the first spot.

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,420
Let's watch all of pitch be and let's dive a little bit into these routes metho the first place to start

41
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,360
is actually to check out the for sale right.

42
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,430
What about searching in phosphates off the pitch.

43
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,250
So here we're going to have the Fassett off the pitch that comes with Lovelle.

44
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,030
And check out that method.

45
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,530
We actually have the routes mid-thought on it as a static method.

46
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,750
And this is because the container and makes the routes I cross because that's the class that spans the

47
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,700
stream and it calls the off method.

48
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,890
Now vitiates going to return to us an instance of the router.

49
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,560
So let's head over to the router that BHB and that should be an illuminated routing you alter that ph.

50
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,860
And we can search if the reason off mid-thought there.

51
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,700
There you go.

52
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,770
That's an afterthought.

53
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,120
And this really starts the typical authentication Wild's for an application.

54
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,950
Now if you check out it registers a logging route and it points that to off logging controller sure

55
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,140
logging form and it gives it the name of logging.

56
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,320
Same with the post.

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,510
Same with a logo which is a.

58
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:50,190
It also we just asked for the registration process and for the password resets therefore behind the

59
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,470
scenes love is simply stream a bunch of rules for us.

60
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,170
And that's why we actually have them here when we try to display them.

61
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,090
If we actually try to do something you should never do any obligations like try to delete the rights

62
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,030
that have been registered in our vendor directory.

63
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:14,550
Give that a safe and notice that in our web the HP we still have this of are being called and we actually

64
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,320
get all the routes we discover that the routes that we register are just the four that we are truly

65
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,380
know when you start an application.

66
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,690
Now our head of back to my vendor directory and make sure I can do what I did and then if we run come

67
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,660
on again.

68
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,540
There we go.

69
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,400
I wrote back the falafel is simply registering this right behind the scenes for us and Lovelle will

70
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,530
automatically overwrite this routes in case we redefine them.

71
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,070
OK.

72
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,720
So if you want to actually change your application visit the register page.

73
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,220
You can do that.

74
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,860
Let's try one of those.

75
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,100
Let's say we wanted to change the register routes and we want our user to want to visit another page

76
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:01,850
for example the registrar that blade the HP in the authentication I mean directory or whatever however

77
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:07,280
you want to customize it you can get around and you redefine the slush registar.

78
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,040
And you just call back for now.

79
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:16,190
And this is automatically going to re write the register about that Lovegood defined in the vendor directory.

80
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:22,930
Therefore let's just say return a string registar user right here and we'll get about all of us so I'll

81
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,240
just log in so we can actually visit that page.

82
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,930
So we try to visit the register and point yeah we get that page and that's because we actually have

83
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,270
to make sure this is defined after all.

84
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,960
All right this is going to be different.

85
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,220
And then we write it.

86
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,020
OK.

87
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,660
So quick refresh again.

88
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:43,670
There we go we have just our user therefore for whatever reason in your application if you want to change

89
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,880
the view or whatever you do when the Vistar you reaches the register out you can go ahead and find it

90
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,970
just after this right here.

91
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,220
Or you can completely pull this out if you want and redefine all the methods.

92
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,450
So Lovelle gives us the possibility to customize that next thing.

93
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,480
What actually happens behind the scenes for our registration.

94
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,250
Let's check out the routes we have here.

95
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,930
We have Forget logging which points to logging control actually logging form.

96
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,420
We also have a post which points to logging control at logging my thought.

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,550
So let's go ahead and try to find those methods if we head over to our logging control which is in a

98
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,000
tree in our control directory.

99
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:28,330
Let's check if we have a show log in form and we don't.

100
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,210
We also do not have a log in my thought.

101
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,770
So what the hell is going on behind the scenes.

102
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,460
I'm going to hit pause for now and in the very next video we're going to deep dive into the logging

103
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,060
controller.
