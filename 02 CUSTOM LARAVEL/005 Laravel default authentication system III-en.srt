1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,790
Let's talk a little bit about the Register's controller and our password resets controller and then

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,100
you'll be done with default controller customization.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:13,360
So if I want my poetry or Sun Radley's C'mon we have this roster when you start to go to the controller

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,160
like the show registration form and the registar thoughts.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,530
But then if we visit that control just like we had with our logging if research for the show registration

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,480
for Mithal we don't have it.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,590
Same thing with the registar method.

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,460
So same thing.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,370
This Mithal Sahid and BNR traits.

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:35,520
So let's visit that Treach retry to visit our show registration for my thought.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,740
Sure enough it returns the expected view.

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,520
The view that we see when we try to register a new user.

13
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:46,600
And then if we also check out the registar thought he actually does everything behind the scenes concerning

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,500
registration.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,030
Let's go ahead and talk a little bit about Avijit stomach phone.

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:56,040
For us it also validated my thought and this method received the request as an array and then validated.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,220
And this way they are Mithal the search really in our registar controller right down at the bottom.

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,830
Therefore if you want to customize what is validated when you're registering a new user maybe you want

19
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:11,980
to customize and make sure that the height is a number of the hightest required under each and all of

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,440
that.

21
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,080
This is where you're going to do that.

22
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:14,600
OK.

23
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:20,800
So just simply putting a new radiation field and automatically going to call that as we see in our registar

24
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,290
method.

25
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,440
Next thing Lavoe utterly rigid starts to use right here.

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,210
I'm just going to break this down to a simple line so you actually understand what is happening.

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,270
So Lovell's firing an event and that event is the really start event and that event is actually coming

28
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:40,050
form eliminate of events we just start and it's passing a user into that event.

29
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:45,900
And this user is coming from calling the Creator thought on this class on the streets and that create

30
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,690
these receiving all of the request data.

31
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,030
Now discreate My thought is actually from our control.

32
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,880
If we visited D'Errico receives an array of all the requests they are and then it creates a new user.

33
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,130
Therefore if you want to customize what is passed into the database when they use ice created this is

34
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,210
where you're going to go to.

35
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:04,760
Right.

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,190
So I should create mid-thought and Lavallee optical going to call that behind the scenes.

37
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:15,030
Next thing it saves the user isn't available and it passes to these new registar events.

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,770
Right so an event is fire.

39
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,650
That's the first hook that we have if we want to customize our system.

40
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,770
Therefore if you want to do something like send a welcome email which we're going to be doing very soon

41
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,410
then we simply need to listen to this particular event and that's it.

42
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,360
Lovely is automatically going to fire that event.

43
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,980
And all of that event is not going to take action.

44
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,480
OK.

45
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:40,960
And most of the time in the community we actually listen to people saying I don't want my users to be

46
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,920
locked in.

47
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,630
As soon as they are registered.

48
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,760
Therefore this is where you actually want to come to right because this is a line of code the lover

49
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,610
uses to logging the user.

50
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,020
So it locks in the newly created user right here.

51
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,280
So if you don't want to log in the user simply override this.

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,450
We just thought that in this line you might not even wanted to get the event therefore you're just going

53
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,410
to validate the data and then call the Creator mid-thought and then pull out this line completely.

54
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,510
Therefore the use I said I'm going to be authenticates that all locked in automatically.

55
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,690
And then finally what level dosshouse Is it cause of which you stop mid-thought just like the authenticated

56
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,040
method that without logging controller if it doesn't find anything in the way you start mid-thought

57
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,970
which is the case right now it's simply going to redirect the user to mid-thought redirect path.

58
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,250
So you try to visit that redirect path.

59
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:36,160
My thought is actually in a redirect such rates what is simply going to do is check if redirector method

60
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,170
exists and then it's going to call that.

61
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,750
OK so you can actually create a redirect to metho it right in your register control.

62
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,450
Or you can actually find a way to pour putty in your registers controller.

63
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,060
OK.

64
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,700
So I think Lovelle already comes with that.

65
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,510
There you go.

66
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,110
So we already have this redirector property and you can actually make sure that the users without access

67
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:03,400
to the home page if you want that's the flexibility that level gives to worse Burts if you want to completely

68
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,430
overwrite what happens when a user asked registar.

69
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,700
Then you need to simply define this when you start method.

70
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,940
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this when you start my thought and I'm going to head over

71
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,190
to my registrar's controller and I'm going to override that method.

72
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,100
Therefore when the user is read you start what I want to do is decide on the use of data.

73
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:28,590
OK so this is what we are going to see when the user is registered and we need to import this request

74
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,690
last of the top.

75
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,410
Now another thing I want to do is actually listen to this event so you understand how it works.

76
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:41,410
So like I said loveall fires an event which is called a widget event and you can actually listen to

77
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,260
these events and send an e-mail when the user is registered.

78
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:44,730
Right.

79
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,260
So let's go ahead and just do that in our events.

80
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:47,750
All right.

81
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,610
We are going to listen to that event.

82
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,190
And how do we listen to that event.

83
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,360
We simply call the events right here.

84
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,490
Eliminate of events and this is the restart event and all we need to do is moppy to all of it's listeners

85
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:06,330
and we of all of its listeners maybe if you want to send an email and if you want to also upload the

86
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,550
user's avatar to Amazon then you can have different business for the same events.

87
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,550
So in this case we want to send an e-mail right.

88
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,090
So I'm going to set up listeners send welcome e-mail.

89
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,550
OK.

90
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,730
So we don't have this list in our class if we want to a recent event January is going to generate all

91
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,200
the listeners that do not exist yet.

92
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,690
OK.

93
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:34,180
So we are listening to illuminates of events we you start and I'm writing that because this registar

94
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:40,120
is coming from illuminate of events where you start and we are telling Lovell every time this event

95
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,970
is fired.

96
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,440
Make sure all of these listeners are caught.

97
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,470
OK so let's generate that in the Petri Aurizon events generate is what we need.

98
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:54,920
Ok I just one that if we check out our Abdur tree you should have little changes like this looseness

99
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,400
and we have a send welcome email listener.

100
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,380
So it has the Handleman 4.6 in the register event.

101
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:08,410
Now what we want to do in this which you start event like we said we want to send a mail to the user

102
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,350
who was just registered and we can get that from that event and we can call the send my thought.

103
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,440
And we simply need to know more about that.

104
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,370
We want to send.

105
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:24,970
We're going to see where you are SAS is going to be the mailable and we can also pass in the user into

106
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,170
this mailable class.

107
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:32,290
So send an e-mail to the newly created user and that mail should be welcome to our SAS application.

108
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,930
Now we need to use the mail for Slate and since we don't yet have that mailable Let's go ahead and created

109
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,810
Peachtree Arsen make mail.

110
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,470
Welcome to our source and we're going to make sure that we have a markdown view for this.

111
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,240
And it's going to be e-mails start.

112
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:46,770
Welcome.

113
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,750
OK so that minable husband creature for us therefore in our app directory we have this welcome to assassinate

114
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,640
B A B and it returns the emails that Welkom we Postino the user.

115
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,290
Therefore we can receive the user right here on our sign that are public property so we can have access

116
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,550
to that in our view.

117
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,690
So in our construct or we're going to set this user to the use of we received from our listener.

118
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,180
OK.

119
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,360
So let's viscid that you welcome that Bader Ph be.

120
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,430
And we can have welcome to our Soest up and we can get the user name to customize the e-mail.

121
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,740
And this is going to be the body of your message maybe whatever text welcome.

122
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,440
OK.

123
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,260
So what do we expect to happen.

124
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:33,790
We expect our registration to take place just as usual but then we expect these registar events to be

125
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:40,420
Fiat which is being fired right here and we expect all that smart for this event to be fired.

126
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:48,310
Also to be one note and the handling right here is going to send an e-mail to the newly registered user

127
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,190
which is the welcome to our SAS e-mail.

128
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,100
And we should receive that e-mail and see the contents.

129
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,520
Now if you have any it set up a trap I've set up my mail drop and I'm good to go.

130
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,960
So let's go ahead and we just a new user and see if everything works like we expect and obviously wants

131
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,840
to use naturally receives that e-mail.

132
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,620
This will just start mid-thought should be called in which the controller simply died on the user because

133
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,840
we are each and AMFA.

134
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:20,710
OK so visit our application visit the registar page registar news or click on the register button.

135
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,760
There we go.

136
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,570
We have we use our Didymos right here just like the specified number we just are on free checkout.

137
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:33,400
We see our Welcome to our SAS e-mail and if we check it out for an office customized exactly the same

138
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,570
way we wanted it.

139
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:40,350
Therefore we see how we can integrate completely into Lovell's default system.

140
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:46,930
Listening to the events calling the appropriate methods whenever we want to and level automatically

141
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,350
takes this takes care of this for us behind the scenes.

142
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:57,850
OK so before I actually stop this video I want to simply show you how you can also customize the password

143
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,990
resets process.

144
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:06,130
So if we had to asked to be control us we also have passwords resets control up and we also have up

145
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:13,120
forgot passwords control controller and we can see it also has a son passwords reset email traits and

146
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,510
we can visit that tree to see what is happening.

147
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:21,970
Shoaling request form is going to return off the passwords to email and we can customize the page that

148
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:27,610
they use of views when he wants to reset his password or put in his email by simply copying this my

149
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,980
thought and customizing it in this control or then send a link to the given user.

150
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:39,130
So send resending email is going to validate the e-mail and then send the reset e-mail.

151
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,380
Now Lavoe uses a book Behind the scenes.

152
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:47,290
But what this simply does is it has a send reset link and all of this is coming from password booka

153
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,380
that Ph be.

154
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,920
So it has a certain reset link meathook.

155
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,040
And if that option was successful the response we're going to get is a string and that string is equal

156
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,630
to this string right here.

157
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,280
OK.

158
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,950
So right here what level is doing this.

159
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,830
It's comparing the string that we received which is this response is equal to the string that is saved

160
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,870
in this constant.

161
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,090
And if that's true then it's going to call this methodes send reset link response.

162
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:18,680
And if that was not true it means it was failed then it's going to call the send we said Lingfield response.

163
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,890
Now this said said Link response just like any other method that we've been told that we we can customize

164
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,360
it however we want maybe you want to send an S M S or do whatever you want.

165
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,670
Once the reset link is send to the use of e-mail you can do that right here.

166
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:40,370
Burts if it's actually filled then this is the method you want to customize send resettling field response

167
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,850
and now by default Lavoe simply returns to use or back with the arrows.

168
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,220
OK.

169
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,270
But you can do whatever you want.

170
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,720
Use or anything.

171
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,210
This is why you can customize that.

172
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:49,720
OK.

173
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,880
And then lover also has this reset password controller.

174
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,580
And like you see it also uses a reset password.

175
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:01,430
Behind the scenes and you can customize this with like to property to redirect the user to maybe the

176
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,300
dashboard page as soon as the password was successfully reset.

177
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:10,330
And in this reset password street you can override whatever you need to reset.

178
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,050
So reset form is also going to return this view right.

179
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:19,460
You'll be the token and IMHO you can customize that if you want by simply copying it into the reset

180
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,620
password control lock.

181
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,320
And this is the reset process.

182
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,890
And the same thing Lovelle validates that we have the correct Ditto's to reset our password and then

183
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:33,830
he uses that verruca again cause the reset mid-thought which returns a string and is saved in a response.

184
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:40,070
So if that string is to password that resets if you receive discloser check it out passwords that reset

185
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,560
then this condition is going to be called.

186
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,110
Ok means we had a successful password reset.

187
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:51,050
Then we are going to call the send reset response my thought and if it was not successful then it's

188
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,480
going to call this field method.

189
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:57,820
And again if you want to customize this you can just copy this into your controller and that's it.

190
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,290
OK.

191
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,820
Very very easy.

192
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:05,180
And if you also want to customize what happens when they use or does it not correctly reset his password.

193
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,850
This is where you're going to do that.

194
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,620
So everything works very seamlessly with Flavell.

195
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,090
OK.

196
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,690
You can customize the system completely just like we have reviewed.

197
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,910
Thank you so much for watching this video up to this point I'm so grateful you did.

198
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,160
I hope you learned a lot.

199
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,930
Let's talk more about customization in Lavoe in the next video.
