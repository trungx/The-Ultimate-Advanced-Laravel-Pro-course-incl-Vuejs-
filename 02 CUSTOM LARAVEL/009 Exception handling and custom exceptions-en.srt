1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,790
Let's talk about custom exception handling in Lovelle Lovelle gives us an extensive possibility of handling

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,890
different Arolsen application in any way we want.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,650
OK so let's go ahead and see how this works.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:18,120
We're going to be working on a very very simple basic idea and that's the idea of maybe passing an idea

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,970
into your own finding to use or without ID and are putting the Jason.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,490
OK.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,650
And if we don't find an ID we're going to handle the custom arrows that will give us.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,620
So let's go ahead and do this.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,870
First of all I'm going to simply set up a database connection and I'm going to use Esco like in this

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,630
case and in my directory database I'm going to create a new database that obscure like fire.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,350
That's it.

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,040
I'm set therefore I can run Peachtree and my great and they have tables.

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,100
And we think I'm going to simply generate some dummy users factory and I'll get 50 use us on our basis

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,040
that my data is OK.

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,250
So we have used us now in our database.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,190
Let's have a watch or web that we found and modified this a little.

17
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,990
So when the use of the home page what we want to return is an instance of user and would find that using

18
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,220
an ID parameter that passed in the request.

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,510
So right here let's get illuminated at CTP request.

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,300
And what I think that sort of levels Konting I would automatically inject it in and would also get the

21
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,270
ID Parminter from the request.

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,410
So we need to accept that in.

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,600
OK so viscid the home while passing on ID and would return to you the use of that ID.

24
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,580
Pretty simple.

25
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,710
OK so let's get the idea of one we have the sun.

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,120
So it works as expected.

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,260
What about an idea that does not exist in the database.

28
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,000
OK.

29
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,440
We have nothing right because clearly we didnt find any use us.

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,840
Now we'll switch this to a kind of feel.

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,770
And this my thought behind the scenes basically is going to try to find a user because you see cause

32
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,950
to find fault here.

33
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,310
And if it doesn't find a user it's going to try a new model not not found exception and passing some

34
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,830
veto into that exception.

35
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,410
OK.

36
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,310
So let's try this again.

37
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,920
And in this case love automatically gives us the four or four Not Found page.

38
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,960
But what if you wanted to do something different.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,880
What if you wanted to handle this section differently without necessarily seeing a full page one if

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,130
you wanted to give a custom Jason response to the user or any different kind of customization you want.

41
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,200
Let's look at how we are going to do that.

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,370
First of all all exceptions in our application passed through the hand-luggage ph which is in the up

43
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,590
sections namespace.

44
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,370
And what happens is when we have an exception we can decide to report it.

45
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,440
Maybe loggy send an email or whatever and we can decide to render it into one.

46
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,520
As to the response.

47
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,940
OK.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,810
So every single exception that is strewn like the modern Afon exception goes through here.

49
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,880
Now we can hijack that.

50
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,210
Now we can hijack that exception.

51
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,400
So if we try to phone model my phone exception that's imported from its namespace.

52
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,470
So you eliminate the.

53
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,840
Cohen Mardale not found exception.

54
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,770
And what we can do is Lovell's giving us an instance of the exception here.

55
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:26,040
So we can say ief exception is an instance of model not found exception then would handle it differently.

56
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,110
Let's just say we return a response Jason and the message hey we couldn't find that user.

57
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,930
So in this random thought every exception is going to be rendered using this parents window but then

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,190
we want to check if the exception is of type M'Donald phone exception.

59
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,420
And what we're going to do is send a custom message to the user.

60
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,650
So let's try this out refresh.

61
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,340
There we go.

62
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,110
We have our castanet Jason.

63
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:58,060
And just like that we are automatically able to handle whatever exception that is strong in lover.

64
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:05,540
Now you can also do this read not for to be exceptions to render custom for all for page and whatever.

65
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,080
OK so next thing we don't want to always handle everything like this right.

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,760
What about the situation where we create our own custom exceptions and told Lavo how to render it.

67
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,190
That's going to be fun right.

68
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,860
That's it.

69
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,870
It's one of the newest features we love 5:25 we can create a new exception and at any instant in application

70
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:31,680
for example if we use our voices and that main page and you know that page is not available to the public

71
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,100
then you can throw an exception.

72
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:40,440
Let's create a new exception and to created in my app exceptions class exceptions directory and it's

73
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,240
going to be called Hacker alert exception.

74
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:43,830
OK.

75
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,560
So hacker alert exception.

76
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:52,840
So Bluhm ph referral would define the namespace and the name of the class is hacker alert.

77
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:59,190
Now every custom exception must extend the exception clause and we need to use that right here.

78
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,060
That's basically all we need to define our own custom exceptions.

79
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,040
Now we need to tol'able what you do with this exception and there are two methods that we need to reference

80
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:15,930
just like in the 130th which references a report Meffert and or when the men thought the report mid-thought

81
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:23,670
sales Lavo whether it should lock this exception or send an e-mail or or inform the administrator that

82
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:30,780
this exception was thrown and the render method like ricin tells Lavo how to handle this exception in

83
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,960
the application itself.

84
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,850
So if you're defining a custom exception you need to declare or report mid-thought and the render method

85
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,180
if there is no report.

86
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,380
Or when may fall in love we will not be able to handle these requests.

87
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:49,740
So let's talk with a random thought and what we are going to be doing is returning a response any time

88
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,530
this session is drawn and we can maybe pass a message.

89
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,340
We have seen hacker.

90
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,070
You've got no luck today.

91
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,920
OK.

92
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:04,950
Dan anywhere in application like the web that PH BE Let's see you have an admin route and you know this

93
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:10,860
route is not public and someone tries to assess this right without being authenticated if not check

94
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,040
means the user is not authenticate at all.

95
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,420
No exception.

96
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,070
So this is going to be up exceptions Hocker alert exception.

97
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,900
OK that's it.

98
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,320
So if the user has not authenticated and he's trying to assess this and meanwhile from the you are l

99
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,010
then for this exception.

100
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,260
So let's check this out.

101
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,420
I'm going to try to visit that you know and thinks i'm not logging.

102
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,360
There we have our message and things I'm not locked in.

103
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,020
There we have our message hacker.

104
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,210
You got no luck today.

105
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,390
But what about reporting these airports themselves.

106
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:49,720
So let's say somebody tried to hack application and we want to automatically Those something or receive

107
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,370
an e-mail or whatever when this exception is thrown when we notice there's a hacker alert.

108
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,810
We simply define our public reports mid-thought and we'll do what ever we want to do.

109
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,670
In this method knowing that level is going to call this method behind the scenes.

110
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,230
OK.

111
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:12,400
So I'm just going to use my lockless right here and I'm going to lock our Critch call alerts and in

112
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,850
case you want to see the methods that we have available for this log you can head over to logging Lobert

113
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,690
Ph be.

114
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:26,260
And we have an alert Kriti call that takes a message and an optional array warning naughties info and

115
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:34,320
all of that some in critical and the message is how car tried to hack us today.

116
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:41,330
So quick refresh and obviously we have our window method caught by vote but what about the report method.

117
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,790
Let's check out our Lavoe the log file in our storage directory.

118
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,370
And there we have the critical lock hacker tried to hack us today as easy as that.

119
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:56,230
So if you want to send yourself an e-mail any time this exception is thrown as such then you can go

120
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:00,080
ahead and do that in your hacker exception alert.

121
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,540
Right.

122
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:07,390
So this gives us a very extensible possibility of handling errors whether they are not phone to be exceptions

123
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:14,440
or for arrows or five what we or what ever exception we try to handle we can handle it by either using

124
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:21,060
a custom exceptions or hijacking the Air Force in our to the pitch.

125
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:26,300
So same thing goes if you want to send yourself an e-mail any time a user is not phone.

126
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,220
Then right here would be a good place to do it so you can see if the exception is an instance of an

127
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,070
exception.

128
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,850
Send me an e-mail with the idea that was passing or whatever.

129
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:37,250
OK.

130
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,660
So that was a great job.

131
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,820
Hope you enjoyed it.

132
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,800
See you in the very next lesson.
