1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:06,550
Welcome back I like us to going to a service or truly understand what fortune is doing for us behind

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,260
the scenes.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:13,450
So when you quit to new sites on FOX on your server is going to send you the logging credentials for

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,020
that server.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,790
For example it's going to tell you about the use of all sorts of metrically Cretans and for each of

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,310
you get into the server you need to use a search.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:22,900
OK.

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,490
So this is a show on how to set up S-sh for the Mac OS.

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,170
You don't need to read all of this stuff.

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,700
All you need to do is run this command.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:38,380
And this is simply saying generates a new S-sh key and then you can set up a passphrase if you want.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,730
And it's good to see that to that directory is a try.

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,640
And finally all you need to do is copy it.

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,180
OK.

15
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,710
So this generates on these copies.

16
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:47,530
That's it.

17
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,890
So once you copy that key you cannot hide your faults.

18
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,690
And on the keys you can add a new key just like I did.

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,220
OK.

20
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:01,970
So when you copy you just need to do a control V or command V and that's going to be the key right there.

21
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,190
And you can give it any name.

22
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:03,770
OK.

23
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,950
So if you don't challenge keep doing that every time you create a news server you can head over to my

24
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,700
accounts and and the key is you can add the SS key right here.

25
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:17,520
Which means every time you create a new server which automatically add that to that server.

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,060
Now if you own a Windows computer what you need to do is such an awful lot show like here it's just

27
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,590
sets off the SS key.

28
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,360
So it's a rather lengthy process but all you need to do is download this Puchi application which is

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,010
going to generate an SS key for your local machine.

30
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,340
Once that's generated You can not copy it.

31
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,740
And also do exactly the same thing in your forte dashboard.

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,350
OK.

33
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,550
So let's head over to my costs and see what's going on inside.

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:50,740
So I'm going to open my terminal and I'm going to see S-sh and the fortunes of Ott's but broadcast the

35
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,550
column or I can actually use to save our IP address.

36
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,130
OK.

37
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,950
So I mean so as easy as that.

38
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,170
Once I set up this message key I can get into my server.

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,700
OK.

40
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,970
So let's see what's going on here unless we see that we have a list of Dubay trees and these trees actually

41
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,270
look at the videos on different sites that they have on the server.

42
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,430
If I was locked in I would then I'm going to actually be in the woods.

43
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,030
But then the Fauchery has permissions right in this direction right here.

44
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,850
OK.

45
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,990
So this is the art we are working with.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,110
So I'm just going to see into you then move that back cause a comb and I'm going to glass right there

47
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:36,700
and you see inside this debate you have an exact replica of our occupation just like it is in our local

48
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,590
machines because we are pushing to get tall and then automatically double front simply Puli from here.

49
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,150
OK.

50
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,940
So this is how the application looks behind the scenes.

51
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,810
Nothing too complicated he just pours into this tree every time we deploy.

52
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,270
OK.

53
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,230
And of course this contributions for genetics and all of that good stuff going on on the server too.

54
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,490
But what I want to show you right now is I will told each direction.

55
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:07,120
So if I sit in a each and and that's when they say into my office and unless you discover that we have

56
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,470
a label does not follow.

57
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,630
So when you want to debunk the application or your application hasn't ever in production what you can

58
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,380
do is simply Nundle.

59
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,000
Now will that lock and the system going to print out the results or the contents of this law will that

60
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,550
not fall because knobbly still going to keep logging into this file.

61
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,210
OK.

62
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,370
So for example this is the latest that I have.

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,110
It says based on your log file you need that but Cazotte whatever.

64
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,700
OK.

65
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,600
So on production is simply going to tell you something went wrong.

66
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,990
But then when you come to your server you can actually see what that was.

67
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:42,520
OK.

68
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,740
So this is because I tried to visit the site without the plain meaning without my greeting in my database

69
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,390
migrations.

70
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:55,420
So if you want to debug the application you can actually Kongji are liable to lock fire in your production

71
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,680
server and then check it out.

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,300
OK.

73
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,350
So we're going to talk about how to set up better error handling in a future.

74
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,820
But for now you just need to understand how to get to your server and sometimes you might need to get

75
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,060
in.

76
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,830
So what's a fix much conflicts or to fix get problems on stuff like that.

77
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,240
This is how you get into your server.

78
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,690
OK.

79
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,000
So to exit the server I just need to exit.

80
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,540
OK.

81
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,030
So that's how we get into our server.

82
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,430
That's how it looks inside.

83
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,990
Pretty much exactly the same thing but now we know almost Phuoc that she's doing for us behind the scenes.

84
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,390
OK so I'm going to hit pause right now.

85
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,230
We're going to keep talking about watching the very next video.
