1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,210
OK guys let's talk about a walker remember we have already queued mail so it's not going to automatically

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,160
send but it's going to send behind the scenes.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,050
So how do we set that up for each.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:16,140
Now if I take you to our Q The PH B which is our config you just got are a lot of configurations right

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,510
here and the ones you use in production is beanstalk.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:19,870
OK.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,530
Just think of it as a walk car that really works well on Linux and it's going to actually run our queue

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,580
rather than us doing P and Q was stuff like that.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:34,710
OK so we're going to change our configuration and production to make sure that uses being stalked.

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,430
OK so in the envy for what you want to do is set up the queue.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,130
So if I take you to my dad in the fall you have a Q drive right here.

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,980
You're going to change that to your beanstalk and lovely so keep your cute life and when stalking is

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,780
going to process your q jobs behind the scenes.

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,290
OK.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,800
So for you to set up install all you need to do is come here look at the conflagrations set or whatever

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,320
you want and you can run it as Diamante.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,050
That's always going to be running behind the scenes.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,940
And then you can start the walk out on the server.

19
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,870
That's it.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,560
That's all we need to do.

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,670
So that it is starting to kill Walker and then we need to configure what applications you use Bernstorff

22
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,280
so we can leave this one for now.

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,310
But in your environment right here for production you need to change it to being stalked.

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:19,980
Okay.

25
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,310
And then finally you need to install the package for ph.

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,620
So companies are required.

27
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,980
This is going to install this package and it's going to automatically register page in your composer

28
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,380
Jason.

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,410
And when you're deploying to production it's automatically going to install that package.

30
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:37,870
OK.

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,940
So there we go right there.

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,520
OK.

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,230
So once you said that all being Vollmann to use penstock you automatically you install this and you

34
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,850
start your q Walker.

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,380
That's all you need to do.

36
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,520
If you had a million queues that are going to be processed by the rescue worker and you can even start

37
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,120
as many workers as you wish depending on your workload.

38
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,690
OK.

39
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,340
So that's basically all you need to do if you once you actually change just now all you need to do is

40
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:12,500
get at everything Gates comments say maybe install being stalked by H and just push to master and level

41
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,880
4 is going to install the newly included package in the car that adjacency if you check out the app

42
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,940
view the deployment log.

43
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,150
We can see that it installed Fahnestock right here.

44
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,670
OK.

45
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,870
So once we set up our queue drive level is automatically going to level 40 is automatically going to

46
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,090
take that behind the scenes.

47
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,050
We don't need to worry about it any more.

48
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,520
OK.

49
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,370
So thank you so much for watching and see you in the very next video.
