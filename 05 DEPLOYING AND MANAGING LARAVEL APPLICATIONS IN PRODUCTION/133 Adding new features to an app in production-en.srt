1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,050
OK guys Welcome back let's talk about something that's really important.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,630
If we look at our website right now we still have these you know toxic stuff from my theme right there.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,410
Burts what I want us to do in this video is actually should to better read the same stone.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:24,300
I want us to integrate it into our application like setting dynamic headers so dynamic titles and descriptions

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,550
such that search engine optimization will be possible in our app and we've done that we are also going

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,770
to learn how to push new features in Java application while it's already in production.

7
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,210
OK so that is what we are going to be coding in this.

8
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,480
So first of all for us to do this we're going to be using a package.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,460
So if you haven't installed it go ahead and install this package right here.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,510
It's really good for setting up SU in a very simple way.

11
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,150
OK so once you do that the next thing is to publish the package.

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:00,070
So BHB Alasan vendor publish which is simply going to copy the configuration for this package into over

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,820
configuring tree and automatically this package is discovered.

14
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,600
So if you want to publish this one right here just going to select the number 6 and that copy that.

15
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,840
So if you had a lot of SEO tools but THP we have the conflagrations right here that we can set by default

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,000
so we can set the sites all by default to be broadcast.

17
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:26,530
We can set the description by default to be the best web development training ever.

18
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,430
OK.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,260
And then right here canonic are all the stuff you can go ahead and suttee it however you want.

20
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:39,180
Right here for the open graph which means for Facebook we're going to set but cost and do exactly the

21
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,050
same thing right here for the euro or with some people a certain law right here that uses the current

22
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:51,590
trial and right here we want to change this to the Twitter handle for this Web site.

23
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,260
OK.

24
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,630
So make sense.

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,500
So we set about default configurations.

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,020
The next thing is to actually set up the settings in our controller.

27
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,500
So for example when we are truly about rended this home page we are going to copy the configurations

28
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,070
right here.

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,770
So this section I'm going to copy it and then I'm going to head over to my phone and call and right

30
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,820
here where we when that was completed I'm going to pass that in and I will get you use as your front

31
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,240
seat at the top.

32
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,570
And every time the speech is about we were in that we're going to set title all broadcast we're going

33
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,180
to set the description to maybe the best web development or churls.

34
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,070
And like I said all I'm going to set it you simply to create your own.

35
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:42,340
So when I said quest and I'll catch your eye and I'm going to do exactly the same thing for the can

36
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,160
only call you.

37
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,420
All right.

38
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:51,090
Here we can just replace this with screencast and the true Chando is going to be by our cost and after

39
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,940
we've said that we were the view.

40
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,600
Now the last thing we need to do is head over to our obdurately the PSP which is our layouts file and

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,330
pull out all of these massive tax rates here and would let our package do that.

42
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,820
So for us to let our package do that we just need to add costs as you generate right here and all of

43
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,610
this is in the documentation.

44
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,750
So once we generate that if we had about 12 a page refresh we can now see that the head is set to the

45
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,810
correct view page source that gives us all of the discussion that we set in our controller makes sense

46
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,320
right.

47
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:28,790
So in our control our what if you wanted to set something or the same thing for our show to see the

48
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,600
speech.

49
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:35,610
So if we want to see a particular service will just paste this in and would set the title to the series

50
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,290
title.

51
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,290
I would also set the description to the series description and I think everything can stay the same.

52
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:49,950
So lets go back refresh and visit this link and we see the title this article is set right here.

53
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,310
Okay.

54
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,940
So looks like our package is working its 10 legionary its in the title.

55
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,270
Of those is good stuff for us.

56
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,410
But one thing I want to do is keep duplicating all of these.

57
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,010
Its messing up our controller.

58
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,000
So what we're going to do is with headbutts over control of the PSP and I'm going to use CO2 right here

59
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,710
because remember all our controllers are using this particular controller.

60
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,070
OK.

61
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,560
So they're like extended it.

62
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,040
So I'm going to cut out this and things that many duplications I'm going to put the directions right

63
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,340
here.

64
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:24,930
So public function and I'll call this function set as you and I'll simply paste that right there.

65
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,640
And for now I'm going to see this function for taking the title and the description.

66
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:31,950
OK.

67
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,530
And when we take in the title we placed the title right here and we we take in the description we place

68
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,520
the description right here.

69
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,230
OK.

70
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,420
So we have this method we can use it in any of our control us wherever we want.

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,770
So right here we can just say this set as you and we need to pass in the title which is going to be

72
00:04:52,780 --> 00:05:00,700
broadcast and we can pass the description which is going to be the best web development training OK

73
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,700
so that's done we can do exactly the same thing for the show series.

74
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,450
So pull out all of this and then the title is going to be the series title and the description is also

75
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,120
going to be the Sui's description.

76
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,640
OK.

77
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,920
So once you set that up you see that it really cleans up our controllers.

78
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,910
Then if I head back to this page and I refresh we see exactly the same thing.

79
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:28,130
If I visit the home page and I refresh which have exactly the same thing for viscid this one you see

80
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,900
the title is set so as you know it's working perfectly.

81
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,970
Ok so now onto the second parts of this detail.

82
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,330
How do you get this to production.

83
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:36,930
OK.

84
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,340
So that's now what I want us to talk about.

85
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,870
First of all our production server is deployed for Mastani.

86
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,150
But then look at where I'm walking.

87
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,530
I'm working on VELHO.

88
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,050
OK.

89
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:52,480
So first thing is when you walk in on a production application you never want to walk on the service

90
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,470
branch or the branch that is deployed to the server because you always want to be able to go back to

91
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,310
your changes.

92
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,770
For example right now when I wanted to stop the changes for the SU I automatically went out into the

93
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:09,470
developed branch and now that I'm happy with everything I've done I can now push to get help and then

94
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,290
make a request for my master brunch.

95
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,420
And automatically it's going to be deployed to my level for each server.

96
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,880
OK.

97
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:23,240
If I had something like maybe Travie see I've running all my test then then automatically gets up I'm

98
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,130
going to make sure all my test box with the CIA before I develop.

99
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:27,590
OK.

100
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,780
So right now I'm just going to open fotch And what does open mean.

101
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,260
I'm going to actually run all my tests.

102
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,200
OK.

103
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,070
OK.

104
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,570
So you can see after making some changes.

105
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,520
Looks like some of our tests are not passing.

106
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,490
So this is the advantage of actually working on its VELLAR branch because you can Wolbachia changes

107
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:52,830
or you can actually work on the failing tests before you merge into a monster and then push to production.

108
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,170
So right now I'm just going to hit pause and then I'm going to figure out why this I'm not feeling.

109
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,010
And then in the next video we're going to tackle it.

110
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,580
OK.

111
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,530
So thank you so much and see you then.
