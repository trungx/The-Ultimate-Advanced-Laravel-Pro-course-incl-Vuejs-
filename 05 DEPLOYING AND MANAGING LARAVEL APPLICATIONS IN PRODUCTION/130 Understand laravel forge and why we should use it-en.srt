1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,360
You're welcome back.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,370
Let's talk about supply an application to our cloud.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,700
Now I want to take some time to talk about why we're going to be using love to forge where we are going

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,400
to be using the task that we are using and why not just deploy to distortion ocean without force.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,060
OK.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,930
So 4G is simply a service manager OK.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,710
It's just going to help us money to survive.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,820
There are some staff that are really really hard to do on the server.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,810
By our own.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,520
OK.

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,590
For example if we want to deploy it or for server or a server that is money for all we need to do is

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:38,130
push call to get help but then setting this up in the server it's not unnecessarily complicated but

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,390
there is a ton of work that you have to take out.

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,820
For example you have to set up another get remote on your server and then every time you listen to are

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,040
pushed to your guitar then you automatically pull from guitar.

16
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,270
That's what actually does.

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,620
But then it promotes that process for us.

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,230
The second reason why we want to use for is because management stuff like cron jobs management stuff

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:08,110
like deployment failures management stuff like queues and database instances in a production server

20
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,360
are really really time consuming really really hard to do.

21
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,440
But each automatically does this for us.

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:13,910
OK.

23
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,010
So low aflat a fort or something.

24
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:20,970
It's a great service I use it day to day and I really really recommend that you use it.

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:21,630
OK.

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,250
So for me it's not free.

27
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,430
It has a plan.

28
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,190
But then for the purpose of learning for it and learning how to deploy before she can go ahead and sign

29
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,410
up for the future.

30
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,930
And I think you can try it for about 10 days or so.

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,890
So you can actually practice how to deploy an application with fotch.

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,710
OK so let's get into it which gives you the possibility of setting up a server with distortion leafnode

33
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,230
zone services that's another.

34
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,470
So you'll need a server provider.

35
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,270
So option is the one they go with.

36
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,660
It has the cheapest Blands is very easy to set up.

37
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,530
The other ones are great but it just depends on your choice.

38
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,050
OK.

39
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:03,180
So go ahead and set up additional ocean accounts and then on the social accounts you just need to come

40
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,010
to your accounts right here on forward.

41
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,840
And then add distortion.

42
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,410
OK.

43
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:14,270
So for example if I come to my service providers You see I have a portion of that right there.

44
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:14,880
OK.

45
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,870
So you can also add the note of vulture.

46
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,570
Okay.

47
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,780
So for example if you want to add distortion.

48
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,940
This is what you're going to need.

49
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,780
You're going to put in your plan right here and then it's going to redirect you to additional options

50
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,160
to authenticate for Vulture you just need to add your API credentials and it's going to take care of

51
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,700
that.

52
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,570
Same for Amazon.

53
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,750
So you just need an account with one of these many and you're going to be paying for the service all

54
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,810
over and you're going to be paying on for just to manage the service.

55
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,410
OK.

56
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,190
So I'll head over to the home page and to actually create a new application.

57
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,180
We need to understand the terminology.

58
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,340
So for each simply has the technology of surveillance and sites.

59
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,850
So on that server we can have multiple sites.

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,450
So for example if I deploy a news server to the ocean it's going to ask me for the credentials the name

61
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,840
of the server or what size of the way where to deploy it and all of this is going to create a news server

62
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,650
on the ocean.

63
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,960
Then it's going to install everything we need to deploy another application.

64
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,070
So this is what makes it easier when we deploy a lot of application readouts for each.

65
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,400
It becomes very complicated to install everything the level needs but then force does this behind the

66
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,330
scenes for us.

67
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,010
So once you create your server you can see a server listed right here.

68
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,770
So if you get into one of those service.

69
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:39,560
So for example you have a server for cost and it has all of the sites that contain costs.

70
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,370
So in the server you can see all the sites for that particular server.

71
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,150
So you can create a new site.

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,550
So think of a server as well.

73
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,930
What does the ocean provide for you a server and then a new site is simply you know a site.

74
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,840
So if I wanted to deploy different instances of level I can do that.

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,550
So in this case we want to deploy maybe you don't need that but cast's dot com.

76
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,080
OK.

77
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,150
Because remember we are actually having a server right here.

78
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,110
You need to go to maybe the ocean to configure the domain name to match the server.

79
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:12,640
OK.

80
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,190
And then on the ocean you need to set up configurations that would allow subdomain routing like this.

81
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,070
We need to choose the domain which means we'll be this site.

82
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,670
This particular site will be available see the cost to come and then the project type is a novel project

83
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,660
and the web directory is public so we can go ahead on the site.

84
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,920
So right here we have the site provisioning and that's it automatically we have a brand new site with

85
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,690
Lovelle.

86
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:45,530
OK so if we head over of that site we need to decide how we want to install the site.

87
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:45,890
OK.

88
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,630
So for example we can pool from guitar or we can create or run your wordpress site.

89
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,800
In this case from.
