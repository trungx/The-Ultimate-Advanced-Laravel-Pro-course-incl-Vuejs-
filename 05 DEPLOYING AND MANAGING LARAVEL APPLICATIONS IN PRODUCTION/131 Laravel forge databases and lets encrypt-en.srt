1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,560
Come back let's talk about the quick reply button.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:10,080
This would allow us to deploy our code from top to LA forte just by pushing to get home.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,720
We don't need to maybe come here and get poor because automatically it's going to do that.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,670
So I'm going to put on pre-deploy I every time I push to the muster branch I wanted to deploy my app

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,470
to production.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,030
OK.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,640
So this is the dupr script.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,810
This is what happens every time we deploy the application.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,830
For example if I click on this button it's going to execute the script and what it simply does is it's

10
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,460
Sidus into that directory where that project is pooled and then it pulls from all region my start which

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,970
means support from top and then it installs all composed dependencies in case there was a new dependency

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,200
that they installed and then it runs Peachtree we Arrison migrate.

13
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:53,680
OK so in case there's all my questions that I need to run it's going to run that makes sense.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,290
So you can edit the script to me to fix your needs or feature what you need.

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,940
So this is the script and.

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:06,770
You are just in case you need to hook up Lovelle force in Georgia ploughmen workflow for example if

17
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:13,020
you're using Trabi CII to run your test before deployment then you can simply tell Trevisa to automatically

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,040
make a post request to this endpoints.

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,630
And he's going to deploy your app.

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Ok so you no longer need to deploy automatically once it's pushed but it's going to deploy metrically

21
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,700
once your tests pass on Travis.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,380
OK.

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,300
And then the branch that is supposed to be listened to.

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,260
For example we want to always deploy from the master.

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,240
So we set up my Starbright.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:34,900
OK.

27
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,740
So that's basically all we need to actually know.

28
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,950
So the next thing we need to talk about is notifications if you want to receive sluffed deployment integrations

29
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,130
to a particular channel you can enable slow interrogations and Vollmann is very important.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,310
And this is and this is where your environment variables are truly stored.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,000
For example if you want to put in your stripe key everything is going to be here.

32
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,570
OK.

33
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,690
So this is private and also your database credentials are going to be here.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,490
So I'll head over to my.

35
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,280
But cost which means the server itself.

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,590
And I'm going to show you the panel that we have right here so we can set up as a search key to S-sh

37
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,780
we can search all my skilled databases for example for this new site that I just created and it creates

38
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,040
a new database and I'm going to call it you then me back cost.

39
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:20,860
OK.

40
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,770
And then I'm going to add that database it's automatically going to create a new secure database for

41
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,590
me right here and I'll head over back to the particular sites that we are working with which is you

42
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,050
Demetre but cost and the main elements.

43
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,660
All I need to do is add this environment and put in my database name and it's automatically going to

44
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,450
collect that database.

45
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:41,950
OK.

46
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,860
So also we can set up the queue which we're going to be talking about in a second but we can also set

47
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,030
up SSL.

48
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,460
For example if you want to install encrypt which is free SSL you can select and create and it's going

49
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,730
to install for you Demetre.

50
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,120
But costs are going to pull out this one right here because we just want for this subdomain.

51
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,580
OK.

52
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:05,580
So I'm going to opt in a certificate and this would actually not work if you've not set up a domain.

53
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:12,390
So Mitry sets up a domain in your ocean because the ocean is the one that is managing the domains for

54
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,150
the server.

55
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,500
Ok so I'm going to activate it right there.

56
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:15,940
OK.

57
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,990
So it's active if I visit the app right now it gets me secure right here.

58
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,670
OK.

59
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,200
So looks like we can visit our our freely and just in a couple of seconds.

60
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,950
Our application is life just like that.

61
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,520
OK.

62
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,850
So in just a few seconds we're about to deploy our application.

63
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,510
We're able to install SSL just by one click.

64
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:41,100
We're able to connect it or get hoby poetry meaning every time we push it's automatic updates on our

65
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,040
site.

66
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,680
Just in a few seconds so this is why we're using law with fotch.

67
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,650
OK so we're going to continue talking about deployment in the very next video.

68
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,130
For now I'm going to hit pause on this video right now.

69
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,640
So thanks so much and see you in the very next one.
